# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED DOCUMENTATION

**This document is DEPRECATED as of v3.5.0 (October 20, 2025)**

The information in this file is **outdated and should not be referenced**.

---

## Why This Was Deprecated

v3.5.0 represents a complete rewrite of the photo capture system. All the issues, fixes, and workarounds described in v3.0.x documents are no longer relevant because the underlying code was completely replaced.

---

## What to Read Instead

üìñ **Current Documentation**: `VERSION_3.5_STABLE.md`

This is the single source of truth for v3.5+ and contains:
- Complete system overview
- Simplified architecture
- Current bug status (all fixed)
- Testing protocols
- Maintenance guidelines

---

## Deprecated Files List

These files describe problems and solutions that no longer exist in v3.5:

### v3.0.3 Era
- `MMKV_BLOCKING_COMPLETE_REMOVAL_V3.0.3.md`
- `MMKV_AUTO_CLEAR_V3.0.3.md`
- `FINGER_CIRCLES_REMOVED_V3.0.2.md`
- `PINCH_TUTORIAL_REMOVED_V3.0.2.md`

### v3.0.4-3.0.6 Era  
- `FRESH_INSTALL_FLASH_BUG_FIX_V3.0.4.md`
- `DOUBLE_CAPTURE_BUTTON_FIX_V3.0.5.md`
- `COIN_NAME_TAP_FIX_V3.0.6.md`

### v3.0.7-3.0.8 Era (The Crisis)
- `CRITICAL_LOCKUP_BUG_FIX_V3.0.7.md`
- `APP_CRASH_INVESTIGATION_V3.0.8.md`
- `SIMPLE_PHOTO_CAPTURE_FIX.md` (superseded by actual implementation)

### Other Outdated Docs
- `SESSION_COMPLETE_OCT18_IMAGE_UNMOUNTING_FIX.md`
- `PHOTO_FLOW_AND_CRITICAL_RULES.md` (rules changed in v3.5)
- Any doc mentioning "safety timeouts"
- Any doc mentioning "nested setTimeout chains"
- Any doc describing animation orchestration

---

## If You're Debugging v3.5+

**DON'T** reference these old documents. The code they describe **no longer exists**.

**DO** reference:
1. `VERSION_3.5_STABLE.md` - System overview
2. `SESSION_COMPLETE_WORKING_VERSION.md` - What changed and why
3. The actual source code - It's now simple enough to read directly

---

## Historical Value

These documents are kept for historical reference only:
- Understanding what problems existed in v3.0.x
- Learning what NOT to do (bandaid fixes)
- Appreciating why v3.5 was a complete rewrite

**Do not use them as a guide for current development.**

---

## Red Flags

If you see any documentation or comments mentioning these, they are outdated:

‚ùå "Safety timeout"  
‚ùå "Nested setTimeout chains"  
‚ùå "Clear timeout in all code paths"  
‚ùå "Wait for component to mount"  
‚ùå "Orchestrate animation timing"  
‚ùå "Emergency reset button"  
‚ùå "Force clear black overlay"  

All of these concepts were **removed** in v3.5.

**Last Updated**: October 20, 2025  
**Deprecation Date**: v3.5.0 release  
**Replacement**: VERSION_3.5_STABLE.md
