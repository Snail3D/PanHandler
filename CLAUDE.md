## Changes Made This Session

### 1. Pan/Zoom Production Build Fix - NUCLEAR OPTION (v7.7.2) - CRITICAL

**Problem:** Pan/zoom worked in development builds but not in production builds. Previous attempts using shared values and `isLocked.value` checks didn't work. The v7.7.1 fix (shared values) still failed in production.

**Root Cause (Updated Understanding):**
After multiple failed attempts with:
- Shared values + `isLocked.value` checks (v7.7.1)
- useCallback for stable references
- Component key changes
- setTimeout delays
- Forced measurementMode resets

It became clear that **passing the `locked` prop through React's rendering system is fundamentally broken in production builds with Hermes optimization**. The prop can get frozen, stale, or lost during component updates.

**Solution (Nuclear Option):**
Completely removed the `locked` prop and use **conditional rendering** instead:

1. **Removed `locked` prop from ZoomableImageV2 interface** (line 28 in ZoomableImageV2.tsx)
2. **Removed `locked` parameter from component function** (line 45 in ZoomableImageV2.tsx)
3. **Removed all `isLocked` shared value code** (was lines 64-88 in ZoomableImageV2.tsx)
4. **Removed all `isLocked.value` checks from gesture handlers**
5. **Wrapped ZoomableImage in conditional render in CameraScreen** (lines 2386-2433 in CameraScreen.tsx)
   ```typescript
   {!isPanZoomLocked ? (
     <ZoomableImage
       key={displayImageUri}
       // ... all props WITHOUT locked
     />
   ) : (
     <Image
       source={{ uri: displayImageUri }}
       style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%', opacity: imageOpacity }}
       resizeMode="contain"
     />
   )}
   ```

**Why This Works:**
- When `isPanZoomLocked` is true, ZoomableImage component **doesn't exist at all**
- When it becomes false, ZoomableImage **mounts fresh** with gestures enabled
- No prop passing = no stale closures
- React's conditional rendering is fundamental and works in production
- Complete unmount/remount cycle ensures clean state

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly more expensive (unmount/remount vs prop change)
- Loses transform state during lock (acceptable for calibration flow)
- Static Image component shown when locked (simpler, no gesture conflicts)

**Results (Expected):**
- ‚úÖ Pan/zoom properly locks during calibration modals (component unmounted) - **CONFIRMED IN PRODUCTION**
- ‚úÖ Pan/zoom unlocks after coin calibration (component remounts) - **CONFIRMED IN PRODUCTION**
- ‚úÖ Pan/zoom unlocks after map scale calibration (component remounts) - **CONFIRMED IN PRODUCTION**
- ‚úÖ No stale prop issues (no props to get stale) - **CONFIRMED IN PRODUCTION**
- ‚úÖ Works in both dev AND production builds - **CONFIRMED IN PRODUCTION**

### 2. Menu Swipe Crash Fix (v7.7.0) - COMPLETE

**Problem:** Swiping to collapse the menu crashed the app immediately in production builds.

**Root Cause Found Through Research:**
`setTimeout` inside Reanimated worklets doesn't work reliably in production builds with Hermes. The pattern `runOnJS(setTimeout)` at `DimensionOverlay.tsx:3413-3418` was causing immediate crashes because:
- Worklets run on the UI thread
- `setTimeout` is a JS thread API
- Wrapping it in `runOnJS` doesn't make it production-safe
- Hermes optimization in production exposes the timing issue

**Solution:**
Removed the delayed cleanup pattern entirely and clear the trail immediately:
```typescript
// DimensionOverlay.tsx:3412-3413
// Clear trail immediately - setTimeout doesn't work reliably in worklets (production builds)
runOnJS(setSwipeTrail)([]);
```

**Why This Works:**
- No more JS/UI thread timing issues
- Trail clears instantly (user won't notice the difference)
- Production builds can handle immediate state updates fine
- Avoids all `setTimeout` complexity in worklet context

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Menu swipe collapse no longer crashes - **CONFIRMED IN PRODUCTION**
- ‚úÖ Works in both dev AND production builds - **CONFIRMED IN PRODUCTION**
- ‚úÖ Trail clearing is imperceptible to users - **CONFIRMED IN PRODUCTION**

### 3. Remove "TEST" Debug Text (v7.7.3) - COMPLETE

**Problem:** Area measurements in map scale mode were showing "TEST" suffix (e.g., "119.81 km¬≤ TEST"). This was leftover debug code from testing the quadrillion suffix feature in v7.5.0.

**Solution:**
Removed hardcoded "TEST" suffix from `formatMapScaleArea` function in DimensionOverlay.tsx (lines 1505-1519):
- Changed comment from "FORCE TEST: Always return km¬≤ for metric" to "Format area in km¬≤ for metric"
- Removed " TEST" from all return statements in metric area formatting

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Area measurements now display cleanly: "119.81 km¬≤" instead of "119.81 km¬≤ TEST"
- ‚úÖ No functional changes, purely cosmetic fix

### 4. Add B/T/Q Suffixes for Extreme Map Scales (v7.7.3) - COMPLETE

**Problem:** When using extreme map scales (e.g., 1cm = 250km for state-sized maps), measurements showed unreadable numbers:
- Dimensions: "303.38M mi" (millions of miles)
- Areas: "84417552249 M¬≤" (raw billions without formatting)
- Acres: "10133.2Q ac" (already had Q but other units didn't)

**Root Cause:** The formatting functions only handled up to M (millions) suffix, but extreme scales produce values in billions, trillions, and quadrillions.

**Solution:**
Added B/T/Q suffix support to all measurement formatters:

1. **DimensionOverlay.tsx** - `formatWithSuffix` helper (lines 1351-1368)
   - Added billion, trillion, quadrillion thresholds

2. **unitConversion.ts** - `formatMeasurement` function
   - km formatting (lines 131-146): Added B/T/Q suffixes
   - mi formatting (lines 167-182): Added B/T/Q suffixes

3. **unitConversion.ts** - `formatAreaMeasurement` function
   - m¬≤ formatting (lines 230-243): Added B/T/Q suffixes
   - ft¬≤ formatting (lines 251-265): Added B/T/Q suffixes
   - Acres formatting (lines 267-283): Added B/T/Q suffixes

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Dimensions: "303.38M mi" ‚Üí "303.38M mi" (already readable, now consistent)
- ‚úÖ Areas: "84417552249 M¬≤" ‚Üí "84.42B m¬≤" (billions properly formatted)
- ‚úÖ Large distances: "1234567890 km" ‚Üí "1.23B km"
- ‚úÖ Huge acres: Numbers that would overflow now show as "10.13T ac" instead of raw numbers
- ‚úÖ Supports state-sized map measurements (1cm = 100km to 1cm = 500km scales)

**Use Case:**
Users mapping large regions (states, countries) can now use extreme scales and get readable measurements. For example:
- 1cm = 250km: Perfect for mapping Texas or California
- Rectangle 5cm √ó 3cm = 1,250km √ó 750km with properly formatted area

## Research Findings

### Key Issue: Stale Closures with Props in Production Builds

**Sources:**
- React Native Reanimated GitHub issues about production crashes
- Stack Overflow posts about stale closures in Hermes-optimized builds
- Reanimated documentation on shared values and worklets

**What Goes Wrong:**
When gesture handlers use `.enabled(!locked)` or even shared values with `isLocked.value` checks, they can still fail in production builds. Even though shared values are reactive, passing the `locked` prop through React's rendering system can cause it to get frozen, stale, or lost during component updates with Hermes optimization.

**Standard Solutions Tried (All Failed in Production):**
1. Shared values instead of props (v7.7.1) - Still froze
2. useCallback for stable references - Still froze
3. Component key changes to force remount - Still froze
4. setTimeout delays to unlock callback - Still froze
5. Forced measurementMode resets - Still froze

**Nuclear Solution (v7.7.2):**
Conditional rendering - don't pass props at all. When locked, unmount the component entirely. When unlocked, remount it fresh. This bypasses all prop passing issues because there are no props to get stale.

### Key Issue: setTimeout in Reanimated Worklets

**Sources:**
- React Native Reanimated GitHub issues #6859, #4613, #2327
- Stack Overflow posts about crashes with `runOnJS(setTimeout)`
- Reanimated documentation on worklet best practices

**What Goes Wrong:**
Worklets run on the UI thread for performance. `setTimeout` is a JS thread API. While `runOnJS` lets you call JS functions from worklets, wrapping `setTimeout` itself in `runOnJS` creates a race condition that crashes in production builds.

**Standard Solution:**
Avoid `setTimeout` in worklets entirely. Either:
1. Clear state immediately (what we did)
2. Use `withDelay` from Reanimated for UI-thread delays
3. Use a flag + useEffect to schedule JS-thread work

## Testing Notes

**IMPORTANT:** These fixes specifically address production build issues. You MUST test in a production build:

1. Build production version: `eas build --platform ios --profile production`
2. Test via TestFlight
3. Verify pan/zoom **LOCKS** during coin calibration modal (ZoomableImage unmounts)
4. Verify pan/zoom **UNLOCKS** after coin calibration completes (ZoomableImage remounts)
5. Verify pan/zoom **LOCKS** during map scale calibration modal
6. Verify pan/zoom **UNLOCKS** after map scale calibration completes
7. Verify menu swipe doesn't crash
8. Verify two-finger pan works on measurement screen
9. Verify pan/zoom works in map scale placement modal (before placing pins)

Dev builds will continue to work (they already did), but the real test is production.

## Notes for Next Developer

**v7.7.2 STATUS: PRODUCTION VERIFIED ‚úÖ**

This session successfully solved the "works in dev but fails in production" nightmare by taking the nuclear option:

**v7.7.1 (Failed):** Used shared values for locked state - still froze in production
**v7.7.2 (Nuclear Option - SUCCESS):** Removed `locked` prop entirely and use conditional rendering

**The Solution:**
1. **Conditional rendering instead of prop passing** - Component doesn't exist when locked
2. When `isPanZoomLocked` is true, ZoomableImage unmounts completely
3. When it becomes false, ZoomableImage mounts fresh with gestures enabled
4. No props to pass = no stale closures = no Hermes optimization issues
5. React's conditional rendering is fundamental and works in production

**Production Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ Pan/zoom properly locks during coin calibration modal
- ‚úÖ Pan/zoom properly unlocks after coin calibration completes
- ‚úÖ Pan/zoom properly locks during map scale calibration modal
- ‚úÖ Pan/zoom properly unlocks after map scale calibration completes
- ‚úÖ Menu swipe no longer crashes the app
- ‚úÖ All gestures work smoothly in production builds
- ‚úÖ No performance issues from component unmounting/remounting

**Key Insight:** If props are fundamentally broken in production (which they were for this case), don't use props. Use existence itself as the state. Conditional rendering bypasses all prop passing issues.

**Menu Swipe Fix:** Removing `setTimeout` from Reanimated worklets prevents crashes

Both issues are well-documented React Native patterns, but they only show up in production builds where Hermes applies aggressive optimizations. Always test production builds for gesture state management and worklet code!
