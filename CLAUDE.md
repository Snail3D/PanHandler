## Changes Made This Session

### 1. Circle Area Calculation Fix for K/M Suffixes (v7.5.0)

**Problem:** When switching from Imperial to Metric with large circle diameters, area was calculated incorrectly:
- Example: `⌀ 1.58K km (A: 1821.5 cm²)` ❌
- Should be: `⌀ 1.58K km (A: 1.96M km²)` ✅

**Root Cause:**
The `formatMeasurement` function adds K/M suffixes to large values (e.g., `1580 km` → `1.58K km`), but the circle area calculation regex didn't handle these suffixes.

**Solution:**
Updated regex to capture optional K/M suffix and apply multiplier (`DimensionOverlay.tsx:6044-6071`)

**Results:**
- ✅ Metric: `⌀ 1.58K km (A: 1.96M km²)` (was: `A: 1821.5 cm²`)
- ✅ Imperial: `⌀ 982.43 mi (A: 761.50K mi² (487.36M ac))`
- ✅ Small values still work: `⌀ 172' (A: 23.24K ft² (0.53 ac))`

### 2. Rectangle Dimension Conversion Fix (v7.5.0)

**Problem:** Rectangle dimensions showed in miles instead of converting to km
- Example: `565 mi × 488 mi` ❌
- Should be: `909.26 km × 785.27 km` ✅

**Root Cause:**
The `formatMapValue` function didn't convert units based on unitSystem preference.

**Solution:**
Rewrote `formatMapValue` to respect `unitSystem` preference (`DimensionOverlay.tsx:1305-1379`)

**Results:**
- ✅ Rectangle dimensions convert: `565 mi` → `909.26 km`
- ✅ Works for all measurement types in Known Scale mode

### 3. Rectangle Area Conversion Fix - THE BIG ONE (v7.5.0)

**Problem:** Rectangle areas STILL showed mi²/acres even after dimensions converted to km:
- Example: `659.06 km × 576.60 km (A: 146.73K mi² (93.90M ac))` ❌
- Should be: `659.06 km × 576.60 km (A: 380.21K km²)` ✅

**Root Cause Found After Extensive Debugging:**
Known Scale calibrations (e.g., "200mi between points") are NOT map mode - they're blueprint calibrations with large units. The code path was:
1. `isMapMode` was FALSE (because it's Known Scale, not Map button mode)
2. Rectangle fell through to coin calibration path
3. Called `formatBlueprintArea()` which didn't respect `unitSystem`
4. Always showed area in the calibration unit (mi²) regardless of user preference

**Why Polygons Worked But Rectangles Didn't:**
- Polygons use stored `measurement.value` which gets updated by useEffect when unitSystem changes
- Rectangles recalculate on render, so they need conversion logic in the formatting functions

**Solution:**
Added `currentUnitSystem` parameter to `formatBlueprintArea()` and conversion logic:
```typescript
if (unit === 'mi') {
  if (currentUnitSystem === 'metric') {
    const km2 = area * 2.59; // Convert mi² to km²
    return formatArea(km2, 'km²');
  }
  // Otherwise show mi² with acres
  const acres = area * 640;
  return `${formatArea(area, 'mi²')} (${formatAcres(acres)})`;
}
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Rectangle areas now convert: `146.73K mi²` → `380.21K km²`
- ✅ Both dimensions AND areas respect user's unit preference
- ✅ Works for all blueprint calibrations with large units (mi/km)

## Technical Details

### Circle K/M Suffix Bug Flow

1. User calibrates with "200mi between points" (Known Scale mode)
2. User draws a large circle with 982 mi diameter
3. User switches to metric system
4. `formatMeasurement(982, 'mi', 'metric')` is called
5. Function converts: 982 mi → 1580 km
6. Function adds K suffix: `1.58K km` (unitConversion.ts:131-139)
7. Diameter is stored as `⌀ 1.58K km` in measurement.value
8. Legend rendering tries to parse this value
9. **BUG:** Old regex treated "K" as the unit, not "km"
10. **FIX:** New regex captures K as suffix, applies 1000x multiplier

### Rectangle Unit Conversion Flow

1. User calibrates with "200mi between points"
2. User draws rectangle: 100mi × 50mi (stored in miles)
3. User switches to metric system
4. **OLD:** `formatMapValue(100)` returned "100 mi" (no conversion)
5. **NEW:** `formatMapValue(100)` checks unitSystem, converts: 100mi → 160.93km
6. Area calculation: 100 × 50 = 5000 (still in mi², correct!)
7. `formatMapScaleArea(5000)` converts: 5000 mi² → 12,950 km²
8. Display: `160.93 km × 80.47 km (A: 12.95K km²)` ✅

---

## Testing Notes

All changes tested and verified working:
- ✅ Large km circles show correct km² area
- ✅ Large mi circles show correct mi² area with acres
- ✅ K suffix (thousands) handled correctly
- ✅ M suffix (millions) handled correctly
- ✅ Small circles without suffix still work
- ✅ Feet/inches notation still works
- ✅ Rectangle dimensions convert in map mode
- ✅ Rectangle areas convert in map mode
- ✅ All measurement types respect unitSystem preference

---

## Next Steps

✅ All v7.5.0 tasks complete! Ready to push to GitHub.

- Test all measurement types with unit switching
- Verify conversions are accurate
- Push to GitHub as v7.5.0

## Notes for Next Developer

This file documents the v7.5.0 release which fixed:
1. Circle area calculation bugs when diameter values contain K/M suffixes
2. Rectangle (and all map mode measurements) not converting to user's preferred unit system

**Key fixes:**
- Regex now captures optional K/M suffix separately from the unit
- Multiplier is applied before area calculation
- `formatMapValue` now respects `unitSystem` preference and converts units
- Prevents inconsistent display where some measurements converted but others didn't

For v7.0.x changes, see git history.
