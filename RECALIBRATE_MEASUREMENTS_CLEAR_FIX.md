# Recalibrate Button - Measurements Clear Fix

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Issue
When user tapped "Recalibrate" button:
- Photo was kept ✅
- Went to calibration screen ✅
- BUT old measurements remained visible ❌
- When recalibrating and going back to measurement screen, old measurements were still there

## Root Cause
The `onReset` handler for recalibrate mode was only clearing:
- Coin circle
- Calibration data
- Zoom state

It was NOT clearing:
- `completedMeasurements` - All drawn measurements (lines, circles, etc.)
- `currentPoints` - Active drawing points

## Solution
Updated `onReset` handler in `MeasurementScreen.tsx` to clear measurements for BOTH modes:

### Recalibrate Mode (recalibrateMode = true)
Now clears:
- ✅ Coin circle → `setCoinCircle(null)`
- ✅ Calibration → `setCalibration(null)`
- ✅ Zoom state → `setMeasurementZoom({ scale: 1, ... })`
- ✅ **Completed measurements** → `setCompletedMeasurements([])`
- ✅ **Current points** → `setCurrentPoints([])`
- Keeps photo, goes to calibration screen

### Full Reset Mode (recalibrateMode = false / "New Photo")
Now clears:
- ✅ Image URI
- ✅ Coin circle
- ✅ Calibration
- ✅ Image orientation
- ✅ Zoom state
- ✅ **Completed measurements** → `setCompletedMeasurements([])`
- ✅ **Current points** → `setCurrentPoints([])`
- Goes back to camera

## Files Modified
**`src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`**
- Lines 108-109: Added store selectors for clearing functions
  ```typescript
  const setCompletedMeasurements = useStore((s) => s.setCompletedMeasurements);
  const setCurrentPoints = useStore((s) => s.setCurrentPoints);
  ```
- Lines 975-1023: Updated `onReset` handler to clear measurements
  - Added `setCompletedMeasurements([])` for recalibrate mode (line 992)
  - Added `setCurrentPoints([])` for recalibrate mode (line 993)
  - Added `setCompletedMeasurements([])` for full reset (line 1014)
  - Added `setCurrentPoints([])` for full reset (line 1015)

## Testing Steps
1. Take a photo and calibrate
2. Draw some measurements (lines, circles, etc.)
3. Tap "Recalibrate" button (red button below calibration badge)
4. ✅ Verify: Photo stays the same
5. ✅ Verify: All measurements are gone
6. ✅ Verify: Calibration screen shows with same photo
7. Recalibrate with coin
8. ✅ Verify: Measurement screen loads with NO old measurements
9. ✅ Verify: Clean slate, ready for new measurements

## User Experience
**Before**:
- Tap Recalibrate → Old measurements haunt you 👻
- Confusing: "Did I already measure this?"
- Measurements from old calibration mixed with new

**After**:
- Tap Recalibrate → Clean slate ✨
- Clear: "Fresh start with new calibration"
- No confusion, proper workflow

## Notes
- This fix applies to BOTH reset modes (recalibrate and full reset)
- Measurements are properly cleared from Zustand store
- No measurements will persist when switching calibration
- Ready for version 1.8 bump ✅
