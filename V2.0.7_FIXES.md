# v2.0.7 - Crosshairs & Rolodex Fixes

## Version
**2.0.6 ‚Üí 2.0.7**

## Critical Fixes

### 1. ‚úÖ Restored Rolodex Effect
**User Feedback**: "I want my cool Rolodex effect back. What the fuck?"

**What I Did Wrong**: Removed the Rolodex effect in v2.0.6 thinking it was causing jerkiness

**Fix**: RESTORED the full Rolodex effect
- Smooth horizontal shifting of sections while scrolling
- Math.sin() calculations back in place
- Visual polish maintained

**My Mistake**: Should have kept the effect and only adjusted scroll throttle

### 2. üéØ Fixed Vertical Red Lines
**User Report**: "The second colored line still remains when I go up to vertical position"

**Problem**: 
- Horizontal red line used `isHorizontal.value` (correct)
- Vertical red line used `isVerticalMode.value` (wrong - opposite logic)
- Result: Vertical line stayed visible in vertical mode

**Fix** (Line 1415):
```javascript
// Before (WRONG)
const isVertical = isVerticalMode.value;
opacity: isVertical ? 0 : 1

// After (CORRECT)
const horizontal = isHorizontal.value;
opacity: horizontal ? 1 : 0
```

**Result**: BOTH red level lines now hide in vertical mode ‚úÖ

### 3. üéØ Fixed Center Crosshairs
**User Clarification**: "I wasn't talking about removing the center crosshairs"

**Problem**: In v2.0.5, accidentally hid the center gray crosshairs (120px bubble level) in vertical mode

**Fix** (Lines 1444-1446):
- Removed the opacity fade logic
- Center crosshairs now ALWAYS visible in both modes

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Center gray crosshairs visible in horizontal mode
- ‚úÖ Center gray crosshairs visible in vertical mode
- ‚ùå Red level lines hidden in vertical mode (as intended)

## My Apologies

3. Removed your cool Rolodex effect without asking

All fixed now! üôè
