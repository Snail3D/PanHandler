# v2.1.7 - Freehand Snap to Existing Points

## Version
**2.1.6 → 2.1.7**

## Enhancement

### 🎯 Freehand Can Now Snap to Existing Points

**Feature Requested:**
"Free line needs to be able to snap to a point initially just like a regular distance line can... I should be able to add a free line to a polygon shape or a mostly complete polygon shape"

**Implementation:**
Added snap-to-point functionality for freehand drawing, allowing freehand lines to connect to existing polygons, rectangles, and other measurements.

---

## What's New

### 1. Start Point Snapping
**When you start drawing freehand**, it now checks if you're near an existing measurement point:
- If within 1mm (~10px) of an existing point → snaps to that point
- Allows starting freehand from polygon corners, rectangle edges, etc.
- Same snap behavior as distance lines
- Heavy haptic feedback when snap occurs

### 2. Mid-Draw Snapping
**While drawing freehand**, it continuously checks for nearby points:
- If you draw near an existing measurement point → snaps to it
- Allows connecting freehand to polygons mid-stroke
- Only snaps if closer than the raw cursor position
- Prevents duplicate points (must be >0.5px from last point)

### 3. Existing Lasso Snap
**End point lasso snap** (already existed):
- When you circle back to your starting point → closes the loop
- Calculates area for closed shapes
- Still works perfectly

## How It Works

### Start Point Snap (Line 3276-3290):
```javascript
if (prevPath.length === 0) {
  // FIRST POINT: Check if we should snap to an existing point
  const screenPos = imageToScreen(imageX, imageY);
  const snapResult = snapToNearbyPoint(screenPos.x, screenPos.y, false); // 1mm tight snap
  
  if (snapResult.snapped) {
    // Snap to existing point - allows connecting to polygons
    const snappedImageCoords = screenToImage(snapResult.x, snapResult.y);
    console.log('🎯 Freehand starting point snapped to existing point');
    Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Heavy);
    return [{ x: snappedImageCoords.x, y: snappedImageCoords.y }];
  }
  
  // No snap - start fresh
  return [{ x: imageX, y: imageY }];
}
```

### Mid-Draw Snap (Line 3345-3372):
```javascript
// SNAP TO OTHER MEASUREMENTS: Check if we're close to any other measurement point
if (prevPath.length >= 3) { // Need a few points before allowing snap
  const screenPos = imageToScreen(imageX, imageY);
  const snapResult = snapToNearbyPoint(screenPos.x, screenPos.y, false);
  
  if (snapResult.snapped) {
    const snappedImageCoords = screenToImage(snapResult.x, snapResult.y);
    
    // Only snap if different from last point and closer than raw position
    if (distFromLast > 0.5 && distToSnap < distance) {
      console.log('🎯 Freehand snapped to existing measurement point');
      Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Heavy);
      return [...prevPath, { x: snappedImageCoords.x, y: snappedImageCoords.y }];
    }
  }
}
```

## User Experience

### Before (v2.1.6):
- ❌ Freehand couldn't snap to existing points
- ❌ Had to manually align with polygon corners
- ❌ Difficult to precisely connect shapes
- ❌ No way to extend polygons with freehand

### After (v2.1.7):
- ✅ Freehand snaps to polygon corners
- ✅ Freehand snaps to rectangle edges
- ✅ Freehand snaps to any measurement point
- ✅ Easy to precisely connect shapes
- ✅ Can extend polygons with freehand curves

---

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Starting Freehand from Polygon Corner:
```
1. Draw a polygon (square)
2. Switch to freehand mode
3. Hold near polygon corner → snaps to corner
4. Draw freehand curve from that corner
5. Result: Polygon + freehand curve connected
```

### 2. Connecting Freehand Mid-Draw:
```
1. Start freehand line
2. Draw freely
3. Approach polygon corner while drawing
4. Feel heavy haptic → snaps to corner
5. Release → freehand connects to polygon
```

### 3. Completing Complex Shapes:
```
1. Draw partial polygon (3 sides of rectangle)
2. Switch to freehand
3. Start at open corner → snaps
4. Draw curve
5. End at other open corner → snaps
6. Result: Rectangle with curved side
```

## Snap Behavior Details

### Snap Distance:
- Uses `snapToNearbyPoint()` with `moveMode = false`
- Snap threshold: **1mm** in calibrated space
- Fallback: **30 pixels** if not calibrated
- Same tight snap as placing distance lines

### When Snap Occurs:
- ✅ Starting first freehand point near existing point
- ✅ Drawing freehand path near existing point (after 3 points drawn)
- ✅ Within snap threshold distance
- ❌ NOT if would create duplicate point (<0.5px from last)
- ❌ NOT if raw cursor is already closer

### Haptic Feedback:
- **Heavy impact** when snap occurs
- Clear indication that connection was made
- Same feedback pattern as distance line snap

## Technical Notes

### Why Start Point Snap?
- Allows intentional connection to existing shapes
- Like distance lines, you want to start precisely at a known point
- Foundation for future shape merging

### Why Mid-Draw Snap?
- Allows connecting while drawing organically
- Don't have to lift and restart to connect
- Natural workflow for complex shapes

### Why Not Auto-Merge?
- Shape merging (combining perimeter/area/color) is complex
- Requires determining which shapes to merge
- Needs UI for un-merging if accidental
- Better as separate feature after testing snap works well

### Future Enhancement:
After testing snap functionality, we can add:
- Automatic shape merging when endpoints connect
- Combined perimeter calculation
- Combined area calculation (if both closed)
- Single color for merged shape
- UI to split merged shapes if needed

---

## Limitations

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ Snap to existing points works
- ✅ Visual connection clear
- ⏳ Shapes remain separate measurements (for now)
- ⏳ Each shape has own perimeter/area (for now)
- ⏳ Each shape has own color (for now)

### Why Separate For Now:
1. **Testing**: Snap functionality needs field testing first
2. **Complexity**: Merging logic affects many systems (rendering, calculation, editing)
3. **Reversibility**: Need UI to split if user didn't mean to merge
4. **Safety**: Better to add merging carefully after snap proves reliable

## Files Modified
- `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` - Freehand snap logic (lines 3276-3290, 3345-3372)
- `app.json` - Version bump to 2.1.7

---

## Why v2.1.7?

New feature for freehand tool - allows connecting to existing measurements. Foundation for future shape merging functionality.

## Testing Checklist

### Start Point Snap:
- [ ] Draw polygon
- [ ] Switch to freehand
- [ ] Hold near polygon corner
- [ ] Feel heavy haptic → point snaps
- [ ] Start drawing from that point

### Mid-Draw Snap:
- [ ] Start freehand away from polygon
- [ ] Draw toward polygon corner
- [ ] Get within ~10px of corner
- [ ] Feel heavy haptic → snaps to corner
- [ ] Continue drawing from connected point

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Snap doesn't create duplicate points
- [ ] Snap only occurs when closer than raw cursor
- [ ] Snap works with rectangles, polygons, distance lines
- [ ] Lasso snap still works (closing loops)

## Summary

**What Changed:** Freehand can now snap to existing measurement points (start and mid-draw)

**Why It's Useful:**
- Connect freehand curves to polygon corners
- Extend existing shapes with freehand
- Create complex hybrid shapes (straight + curved lines)
- Foundation for future shape merging

**Next Step:** After testing, can add automatic shape merging (combined perimeter/area/color)
