# V2.2.12 - Fixed Calibration Screen Not Loading

## Issue
After taking a photo, the calibration screen wasn't loading at all - completely broken.

## Root Cause
In v2.2.11, we added auto-opening of the coin selector when no coin was selected:
```typescript
setShowCoinSelector(true);  // Immediately on mount
```

This caused a race condition:
1. Component mounts
2. Coin selector opens immediately (opacity animates 0→1)
3. But component hasn't finished initial render yet
4. Image and UI don't appear properly
5. Screen appears broken/blank

## Fix
Added a 500ms delay before opening the coin selector:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (lastSelectedCoin) {
    const coin = getCoinByName(lastSelectedCoin);
    if (coin) {
      setSelectedCoin(coin);
    } else {
      // Last coin not found - open selector after delay
      setTimeout(() => setShowCoinSelector(true), 500);
    }
  } else {
    // No last coin - open selector after delay  
    setTimeout(() => setShowCoinSelector(true), 500);
  }
}, [lastSelectedCoin]);
```

## Why This Works
1. Component mounts and renders fully
2. Image appears ✅
3. Coin circle renders ✅
4. After 500ms → Coin selector fades in ✅
5. User can search and select coin ✅

## Expected Behavior

### First Time User
1. Take photo
2. Calibration screen loads with image visible
3. **After 0.5 seconds** → Coin selector fades in at top
4. Search and select coin
5. Selector fades out
6. Bottom bar appears
7. Calibrate and lock in

### Returning User  
1. Take photo
2. Last selected coin loads automatically
3. Bottom bar appears immediately
4. Can calibrate right away
