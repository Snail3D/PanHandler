# v2.1.0 - Orientation-Aware Shutter Button

## Version
**2.0.9 → 2.1.0**

## Critical Fix

### 🎯 Shutter Button Behavior Based on Orientation
**User Report**: "I just tapped in vertical mode to take a picture and it seems like it tried to go into auto mode and then once I tapped later when it was in auto mode, it seemed to take a picture. That button state should change fluidly between the vertical and horizontal modes"

#### Problem:
- User taps button in vertical mode (expecting quick capture)
- Phone orientation changes during the tap
- Button enters "hold mode" for auto-capture (wrong behavior)
- Inconsistent button behavior causes confusion

#### Root Cause:
Button didn't check orientation at press time - it always entered hold mode regardless of whether phone was horizontal or vertical.

## The Fix

### Orientation-Locked Button Behavior (Lines 1850-1869):

**Before**: Always entered hold mode on press
```javascript
onPressIn={() => {
  setIsHoldingShutter(true); // Always entered hold mode!
  // ...
}}
```

**After**: Checks orientation at press time
```javascript
onPressIn={() => {
  const orientationAtPress = isHorizontal.value; // Lock orientation
  holdStartTimeRef.current = Date.now();
  
  if (orientationAtPress) {
    // Horizontal mode: Enable auto-capture hold mode
    setIsHoldingShutter(true);
    // Fade out instructions
  } else {
    // Vertical mode: Just haptic, no hold state
    Haptics.impactAsync(...);
  }
}}
```

## Button Behavior by Orientation

### Horizontal Mode (Looking Down):
- **Press & Hold**: Enters auto-capture mode
  - Border changes to crosshair color
  - Instructions fade out
  - Auto-capture when aligned
- **Quick Tap** (< 200ms): Manual capture immediately

### Vertical Mode (Upright):
- **Press & Hold**: No auto-capture mode (disabled)
  - Button stays normal appearance
  - No instruction fade
  - Just haptic feedback
- **Quick Tap** (< 200ms): Manual capture immediately

### Key Points:
- ✅ Orientation locked at moment of press (no mid-tap changes)
- ✅ Quick tap always works in both modes
- ✅ Hold mode only active in horizontal orientation
- ✅ Consistent, predictable behavior

## Visual Feedback

### Horizontal Mode - Holding:
```
Button appearance:
- Border: Crosshair color (indicates auto-mode)
- Inner circle: Crosshair glow color
- Instructions: Fade out
- Behavior: Auto-capture when aligned
```

### Vertical Mode - Holding:
```
Button appearance:
- Border: Shutter glow color (normal)
- Inner circle: Shutter glow color (normal)  
- Instructions: Stay visible
- Behavior: Just waiting for release to capture
```

## Technical Details

### Changes Made (Lines 1850-1869):

1. **Capture orientation at press**:
   ```javascript
   const orientationAtPress = isHorizontal.value;
   ```

2. **Conditional hold state**:
   ```javascript
   if (orientationAtPress) {
     setIsHoldingShutter(true); // Only in horizontal
   }
   ```

3. **Quick tap always works**:
   ```javascript
   if (holdDuration < 200 && !isCapturing) {
     takePicture(); // Works in any orientation
   }
   ```

## User Experience Impact

### Before:
- ❌ Confusing behavior when tilting during press
- ❌ Vertical mode could enter auto-capture (wrong)
- ❌ Button state changed mid-tap
- ❌ Unpredictable

### After:
- ✅ Orientation locked at press moment
- ✅ Vertical mode never enters auto-capture
- ✅ Consistent button behavior
- ✅ Predictable and intuitive

## Testing

### Horizontal Mode:
- [ ] Hold button → should enter auto-capture mode (border changes color)
- [ ] Hold & align phone → auto-capture triggers
- [ ] Quick tap → immediate capture
- [ ] Border should show crosshair color when holding

### Vertical Mode:
- [ ] Hold button → should NOT enter auto-capture mode
- [ ] Hold button → border stays normal color
- [ ] Quick tap → immediate capture
- [ ] Instructions should NOT fade out when holding

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Tap in vertical, tilt to horizontal mid-press → stays in quick-tap mode
- [ ] Tap in horizontal, tilt to vertical mid-press → stays in hold mode
- [ ] Rapid orientation changes while pressing → consistent with press-time orientation

---

## Notes

- Orientation is "locked" at the moment of `onPressIn`
- This prevents confusing behavior during mid-tap orientation changes
- Quick tap (< 200ms) always works regardless of orientation
- Hold behavior only active when phone is horizontal at press time
- Visual feedback (border color) matches the actual mode

## Files Modified
- `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx` - Orientation-aware button logic
- `app.json` - Version 2.1.0

## Why v2.1.0?

This is a significant UX improvement that changes core button behavior based on orientation. Bumped minor version to reflect the importance of this feature.
