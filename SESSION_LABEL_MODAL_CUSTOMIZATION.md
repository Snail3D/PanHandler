# Session Complete: Label Modal Button Customization

**Date**: October 16, 2025

## What Was Completed

### Label Modal Action-Specific UI
Customized the LabelModal to show different button text and icons based on whether the user is saving to photos or emailing:

1. **Updated Prompt Text**
   - Changed from "What is this?" / shape-specific prompts
   - Now always shows: **"What are we calling this thing?"**
   - More casual and friendly tone

2. **Dynamic Button Based on Action**
   - **When Saving**: Button shows "Save" with disk icon (üìÅ)
   - **When Emailing**: Button shows "Email" with mail icon (‚úâÔ∏è)
   - Uses `actionType` prop to determine which to display

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Added `actionType?: 'save' | 'email'` prop to LabelModalProps
   - Button dynamically renders icon and text based on actionType
   - DimensionOverlay passes `pendingAction` state as actionType prop
   - Defaults to 'save' if no action type is provided

## Files Modified

### `/src/components/LabelModal.tsx`
- Added `actionType` prop with default value of 'save'
- Updated button text to conditionally show "Save" or "Email"
- Updated button icon to conditionally show 'save' or 'mail' Ionicon
- Changed prompt text to "What are we calling this thing?"
- Lines modified: 518, 658, 727-735, 742

### `/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`
- Passed `actionType={pendingAction || 'save'}` to LabelModal component
- Line modified: 6303

## Technical Context

The flow works as follows:
1. User taps Save button ‚Üí `handleExport()` ‚Üí `setPendingAction('save')` ‚Üí shows modal
2. User taps Email button ‚Üí `handleEmail()` ‚Üí `setPendingAction('email')` ‚Üí shows modal
3. LabelModal receives `actionType` prop and shows appropriate button
4. User completes action ‚Üí `handleLabelComplete()` checks `pendingAction` to perform save or email

## User Experience Improvements

- **Clearer Intent**: Users now see "Email" button when emailing, making the action more explicit
- **Visual Feedback**: Icon changes (save disk vs mail envelope) provide immediate visual understanding
- **Casual Tone**: "What are we calling this thing?" feels more conversational and less formal
- **Consistency**: Same prompt text regardless of shape type, reducing cognitive load

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test save flow: Tap save button ‚Üí verify modal shows "Save" button with disk icon
2. Test email flow: Tap email button ‚Üí verify modal shows "Email" button with mail icon
3. Verify prompt text shows "What are we calling this thing?" in both cases
4. Test with and without labels to ensure both paths work
5. Verify "Leave Blank" button still works as expected
