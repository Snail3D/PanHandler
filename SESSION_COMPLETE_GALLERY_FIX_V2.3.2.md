# Gallery Import & Photo Capture Fix v2.3.2

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Gallery Button Not Working
**Problem**: Clicking gallery button opened picker, but photo type modal never appeared.

**Root Cause**: `pickImage()` was trying to show `PhotoTypeSelectionModal` while in CAMERA MODE. The modal only renders properly when in measurement/calibration modes.

**Fix**: Updated `pickImage()` to match the photo capture pattern:
- Transition to measurement mode FIRST
- THEN show the photo type modal
- Defer AsyncStorage writes

### 2. ✅ Photo Capture Already Fast
- The 50ms delay before capture was already removed in a previous fix
- Photo capture is instant with no blocking

## Code Changes

**File**: `/home/user/workspace/src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`

**Lines 1466-1526**: Complete rewrite of `pickImage()` function
- Added transition to measurement mode before showing modal
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging  
- Follows same pattern as photo capture (wall mode)
- Defers AsyncStorage writes to prevent blocking

## Pattern Used

```typescript
// OLD (BROKEN):
pickImage() {
  setCapturedPhotoUri(uri);
  setShowPhotoTypeModal(true); // ❌ Doesn't work in camera mode!
}

// NEW (FIXED):
pickImage() {
  setCapturedPhotoUri(uri);
  
  // Transition to measurement mode FIRST
  setIsTransitioning(true);
  transitionBlackOverlay = withTiming(1, { duration: 150 });
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    setMode('measurement'); // ✅ Now in measurement mode
    setPendingPhotoUri(uri);
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      setShowPhotoTypeModal(true); // ✅ Modal works!
    }, 50);
  }, 150);
}
```

## Testing

- [ ] Gallery button opens picker
- [ ] Selecting photo shows photo type modal
- [ ] Photo type modal works (Coin/Map/Blueprint selection)
- [ ] Photo transitions smoothly
- [ ] No freezing or delays
