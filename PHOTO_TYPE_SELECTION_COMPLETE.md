# ✅ Photo Type Selection Modal - Complete Integration

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete ✅  
**Version:** v2.3.3+

---

## 🎯 What We Built

Implemented a **photo type selection modal** that appears when users import photos from the gallery, allowing them to choose the appropriate calibration method for their photo type.

---

## 📦 Components Created

### **1. PhotoTypeSelectionModal.tsx** ✅
**Location:** `/home/user/workspace/src/components/PhotoTypeSelectionModal.tsx`

**Design:**
- Glassmorphic modal with BlurView backdrop
- 5 calibration options with emoji icons
- Each option has colored icon container + description
- Cancel button at bottom
- Haptic feedback on all interactions

**Options:**
1. 🪙 **Coin Reference** - "Classic calibration with a coin"
2. ✈️ **Aerial Photo** - "Auto-calibrate from drone metadata"
3. 🗺️ **Map Mode** - "Use verbal scale (1 inch = 10 miles)"
4. 📐 **Blueprint** - "Calibrate from scale bar"
5. 📏 **Known Scale** - "Two-point with known distance"

**Props:**
```typescript
interface PhotoTypeSelectionModalProps {
  visible: boolean;
  onSelect: (type: PhotoType) => void;
  onCancel: () => void;
}

export type PhotoType = 'coin' | 'aerial' | 'map' | 'blueprint' | 'knownScale';
```

---

## 🔧 Integration Complete

### **MeasurementScreen.tsx** ✅

**State Added:**
```typescript
const [showPhotoTypeModal, setShowPhotoTypeModal] = useState(false);
const [pendingPhotoUri, setPendingPhotoUri] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [currentPhotoType, setCurrentPhotoType] = useState<PhotoType | null>(null);
```

**Handler Added:**
```typescript
const handlePhotoTypeSelection = (type: PhotoType) => {
  setShowPhotoTypeModal(false);
  setCurrentPhotoType(type);
  
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium);
  
  // Transition to calibration
  setIsTransitioning(true);
  transitionBlackOverlay.value = withTiming(1, { duration: 150 });
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (type === 'map') {
      setSkipToMapMode(true);
    }
    setMode('zoomCalibrate');
    
    transitionBlackOverlay.value = withTiming(0, { duration: 250 });
    setTimeout(() => setIsTransitioning(false), 250);
  }, 150);
};
```

**Modal Trigger (in pickImage function - line ~1467):**
```typescript
// NOT a drone (or no auto-calibration data) - Show photo type selection modal
setPendingPhotoUri(asset.uri);
setShowPhotoTypeModal(true);
```

**Modal Render (line ~2496):**
```tsx
{/* Photo Type Selection Modal - For imported photos */}
<PhotoTypeSelectionModal
  visible={showPhotoTypeModal}
  onSelect={handlePhotoTypeSelection}
  onCancel={() => setShowPhotoTypeModal(false)}
/>
```

## 🔄 User Flow

### **Camera Photos (No Modal):**
1. User taps capture button
2. Photo taken with auto-level
3. → Goes directly to coin calibration
4. ✅ No modal shown

### **Imported Photos (Modal Shows):**
1. User taps gallery/import button
2. Picks photo from library
3. **Drone detection runs:**
   - If drone + overhead → Auto-calibrate (no modal)
   - If drone + tilted → Manual altitude modal
   - **If NOT drone** → **Photo Type Selection Modal shows** ✨
4. User selects photo type:
   - Coin → Standard coin calibration
   - Aerial → (Currently goes to coin - Phase 2 will auto-detect)
   - Map → Activates Map Mode, skips coin selector
   - Blueprint → (Currently goes to coin - Phase 2 will show scale bar)
   - Known Scale → (Currently goes to coin - Phase 2 will show two-point)
5. Smooth black transition
6. → Goes to ZoomCalibration screen

## ✅ Phase 1 Complete - What Works

- [x] Modal component created with beautiful UI
- [x] 5 options with emojis and descriptions
- [x] Integration into MeasurementScreen
- [x] State management (showPhotoTypeModal, currentPhotoType)
- [x] Handler function (handlePhotoTypeSelection)
- [x] Modal triggered on non-drone photo imports
- [x] NOT triggered on camera photos (correct!)
- [x] Cancel button works
- [x] Haptic feedback on all interactions
- [x] Smooth transitions (black overlay)
- [x] Map mode special case (setSkipToMapMode)
- [x] TypeScript types exported properly

---

## 🚧 Phase 2 - TODO (Conditional UI in ZoomCalibration)

### **Next Steps:**
1. Pass `currentPhotoType` prop to ZoomCalibration component
2. Update ZoomCalibration to accept `photoType?: PhotoType` prop
3. Conditionally show/hide UI based on photo type:
   - **Coin:** Show coin selector + coin calibration (default - current behavior)
   - **Aerial:** Auto-detect drone → Auto-calibrate OR show manual altitude modal
   - **Map:** Hide coin selector, show verbal scale input (already implemented via skipToMapMode!)
   - **Blueprint:** Hide coin selector, show scale bar placement UI
   - **Known Scale:** Hide coin selector, show two-point distance input + line placement

### **Files to Modify (Phase 2):**
- `src/components/ZoomCalibration.tsx`
  - Add `photoType` prop to interface
  - Wrap coin selector in conditional: `{!photoType || photoType === 'coin' ? <CoinSelector /> : null}`
  - Add blueprint scale bar UI
  - Add known scale two-point UI

- `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`
  - Pass prop: `<ZoomCalibration photoType={currentPhotoType} ... />`

**Total Lines Added:** ~306 lines
**Breaking Changes:** None
**Compilation:** ✅ Success

## 🎨 Design Notes

### **Visual Design:**
- Glassmorphic with BlurView (intensity: 90, tint: dark)
- Dark overlay: `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`
- White text on dark blur
- Colored icon backgrounds match option theme:
  - Coin: Orange `rgba(255,149,0,0.15)`
  - Aerial: Teal `rgba(0,199,190,0.15)`
  - Map: Blue `rgba(0,122,255,0.15)`
  - Blueprint: Purple `rgba(88,86,214,0.15)`
  - Known Scale: Green `rgba(52,199,89,0.15)`

### **Accessibility:**
- Large tap targets (each option ~70px height)
- Clear visual hierarchy (title → subtitle → options → cancel)
- Haptic feedback (Medium on select, Light on cancel)
- Pressable states (pressed state reduces opacity)
- Backdrop tap to dismiss

### **Performance:**
- Modal only renders when `visible={true}`
- No heavy animations (simple fade)
- BlurView is optimized by Expo
