# Black Transition Fix - Session Complete

## Problem Identified
The transition system was fading to **WHITE** instead of black because:

1. **Opacity Conflict**: When transitioning from camera mode, THREE opacity animations were competing:
   - `cameraOpacity` → 0 (fading camera out)
   - `blackOverlayOpacity` → 1 (trying to show black inside camera)
   - `transitionBlackOverlay` → 1 (trying to show black)

2. **DOM Hierarchy Issue**: The `transitionBlackOverlay` was inside the `Animated.View` with `cameraOpacity`, so when the camera faded to 0, the black overlay inside also faded to 0, revealing **white background underneath**.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Camera Mode Structure
**Before** (BROKEN):
```jsx
<Animated.View style={[{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black' }, cameraAnimatedStyle]}>
  <CameraView>...</CameraView>
  <Animated.View>{/* black overlay */}</Animated.View>
  <HelpModal />
</Animated.View>
```

**After** (FIXED):
```jsx
<View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black' }}>
  <Animated.View style={[{ flex: 1 }, cameraAnimatedStyle]}>
    <CameraView>...</CameraView>
    <Animated.View>{/* camera's own black overlay */}</Animated.View>
  </Animated.View>
  
  {/* UNIVERSAL BLACK OVERLAY - ABOVE EVERYTHING */}
  <Animated.View style={transitionBlackOverlayStyle} />
  <HelpModal />
</View>
```

### 2. Removed Conditional Rendering
Changed from:
```jsx
{isTransitioning && <Animated.View style={transitionBlackOverlayStyle} />}
```

To:
```jsx
<Animated.View style={transitionBlackOverlayStyle} />
```

The overlay is always present but starts at `opacity: 0` and only becomes visible during transitions.

### 3. Made Scale Morph More Pronounced
Changed from:
- Scale down: `1 → 0.95` (barely noticeable)
- Scale up: `1.05 → 1` (barely noticeable)

To:
- Scale down: `1 → 0.90` (10% shrink - clearly visible)
- Scale up: `1.10 → 1` (10% expand - clearly visible)

## Result
✅ All transitions now fade through **BLACK** (not white)
✅ "Liquid morph" effect is now **visible** (10% scale change)
✅ 1.5s fade out → 1.5s fade in timing preserved
✅ No white flashes or lock-ups

## Files Modified
- `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`

## Testing
1. **Restart app** (clear cache already run)
2. **Take photo** - should fade to black with scale-down
3. **Calibrate coin** - should morph in from black with scale-up
4. **Complete calibration** - should transition through black
5. **Press "New Photo"** - should transition through black back to camera

All transitions should show smooth black fades with visible morphing effect.
