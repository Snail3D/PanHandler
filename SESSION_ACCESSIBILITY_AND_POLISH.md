# 🎨 Bubble Level: Major Polish & Accessibility Update

## Summary
Implemented major improvements to bubble level: accessibility support for Parkinson's/tremors, complementary session colors for crosshairs and bubble, enhanced ethereal glow effect, improved smoke trail, and fixed vertical mode X-axis movement.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Accessibility Support for Parkinson's/Tremor Users

**Problem**: Users with hand tremors or Parkinson's can't hold phone perfectly still, making auto-capture impossible.

**Solution**: After 10 seconds of holding the shutter button, automatically relax the stability requirements.

**Relaxed Tolerances** (after 10 seconds):
- Angle stability: `2°` → `5°` variance allowed
- Motion stability: `0.1` → `0.25` acceleration variance
- Alignment "good": `±2°` → `±5°`
- Alignment "warning": `±10°` → `±15°`

**Implementation**:
- Track hold duration via `holdStartTime.current`
- Calculate `isAccessibilityMode = holdDuration > 10 seconds`
- Apply relaxed thresholds when in accessibility mode
- Reset timer when user releases button

**Impact**: Users with tremors can now successfully capture photos by holding for 10+ seconds! 🦾

### 2. ✅ Complementary Session Colors

**Changed**: Instead of random single color, now picks complementary color pairs per session.

**Color Pairs** (7 combinations):
1. 🔵 Blue crosshairs vs 🟠 Amber bubble
2. 🟣 Purple crosshairs vs 🟢 Green bubble
3. 🩷 Pink crosshairs vs 🩵 Cyan bubble
4. 🔴 Red crosshairs vs 🔵 Blue bubble
5. 🟢 Green crosshairs vs 🟣 Purple bubble
6. 🟠 Amber crosshairs vs 🩷 Pink bubble
7. 🩵 Cyan crosshairs vs 🔴 Red bubble

**Crosshairs**: Now solid session color (no more red/yellow/green status colors)
- Base glow: 60% opacity, 8px radius
- When centered: Up to 100% opacity, 16px radius

**Bubble**: Opposing color for visual contrast and fun!

**Result**: Beautiful, playful color combinations that change every session! 🎨

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Bubble Glow (Less Pool Ball, More Ethereal)

**Problem**: Bubble looked like a solid pool ball, not mystical/glowing.

**Changes**:
- **Size**: 18px → 20px (more presence)
- **Removed solid border** (was making it look like pool ball)
- **Semi-transparent base**: 85% opacity (ethereal look)
- **Larger shadow**: 16px → 24px radius (more mystique)
- **Pure white core**: 10px bright center (light source effect)
- **Soft outer aura**: 6px diffuse glow ring at 20% opacity

**Visual Layers** (outside → inside):
1. Soft aura ring (6px, 20% opacity bubble glow color)
2. Main shadow (24px radius, full opacity)
3. Semi-transparent bubble body (85% opacity)
4. Pure white core (10px, 100% white with shadow)

**Result**: Ethereal, floating orb that glows from within! 🔮✨

### 4. ✅ Improved Smoke Trail (More Smoky)

**Changes**:
- **Quadratic fade**: `opacity = progress²` (smoother dissipation)
- **Dynamic scaling**: Start tiny (30%), grow to full size
- **Dynamic blur**: Older particles blur more (0-8px)
- **Larger particles**: 6px → 8px base size
- **Subtler base opacity**: 50% → 40%
- **Shadow fades with particle**: `shadowOpacity = progress * 0.6`

**Effect**: Particles now look like dissipating smoke, not solid dots! 🌫️

---

### 5. ✅ Fixed Vertical Mode X-Axis Movement

**Problem**: In vertical mode, bubble was locked to X=0 (couldn't move left/right).

**Solution**: Use `gamma` (left/right rotation) for X-axis movement in vertical mode.

```typescript
// Before: X locked to center
bubbleX.value = withSpring(0, ...);

// After: X follows gamma (left/right tilt)
const gammaOffset = -(gamma / 15) * maxBubbleOffset;
bubbleX.value = withSpring(gammaOffset, ...);
```

**Result**: In vertical mode, bubble now moves on BOTH axes! 🎯

## Technical Implementation

### Accessibility Timer
```typescript
// Track hold duration
const holdStartTime = useRef<number>(0);

// On press in
onPressIn={() => {
  holdStartTime.current = Date.now();
}}

// Calculate if in accessibility mode
const holdDuration = (Date.now() - holdStartTime.current) / 1000;
const isAccessibilityMode = holdDuration > 10;

// Apply relaxed thresholds
const angleThreshold = isAccessibilityMode ? 5 : 2;
const motionThreshold = isAccessibilityMode ? 0.25 : 0.1;
```

### Complementary Colors
```typescript
const [sessionColors] = useState(() => {
  const colorPairs = [
    { crosshair: { main: '#3B82F6', glow: '#60A5FA' }, 
      bubble: { main: '#F59E0B', glow: '#FBBF24' } },
    // ... 6 more pairs
  ];
  return colorPairs[Math.floor(Math.random() * colorPairs.length)];
});
```

### Ethereal Bubble Structure
```jsx
<Animated.View style={[{ 
  backgroundColor: bubbleColor.main,
  opacity: 0.85, // Semi-transparent
  shadowRadius: 24, // Large glow
  // No border!
}, bubbleStyle]}>
  {/* Pure white core */}
  <View style={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(255,255,255,1.0)' }} />
  {/* Soft outer aura */}
  <View style={{ backgroundColor: bubbleColor.glow, opacity: 0.2 }} />
</Animated.View>
```

### Smoke Trail Fade
```typescript
const progress = (index + 1) / total; // 0 to 1
const opacity = progress * progress; // Quadratic fade
const blur = (1 - progress) * 8; // More blur for older
```

## Testing Checklist

### Accessibility (Parkinson's/Tremor Support)
- [ ] Hold shutter button for 3 seconds → strict tolerance (hard to capture)
- [ ] Continue holding for 10+ seconds → looser tolerance (easier to capture)
- [ ] Verify auto-capture happens even with slight hand movement after 10s
- [ ] Release button → timer resets

### Complementary Colors
- [ ] Open camera → Note crosshair and bubble colors
- [ ] Verify they're different/complementary (not same color)
- [ ] Close and reopen app → Different color pair selected

### Crosshairs
- [ ] Crosshairs are solid color (not red/yellow/green)
- [ ] Crosshairs glow more when bubble is centered
- [ ] Center dot matches crosshair color

### Bubble Glow
- [ ] Bubble doesn't look like a solid pool ball
- [ ] Has soft, ethereal glow around it
- [ ] Bright white core visible in center
- [ ] Subtle aura ring around bubble

### Smoke Trail
- [ ] Trail fades smoothly (not abrupt)
- [ ] Older particles appear more diffuse/blurry
- [ ] Looks like dissipating smoke, not solid dots

### Vertical Mode
- [ ] Hold phone vertically
- [ ] Tilt left → bubble moves left (X-axis works!)
- [ ] Tilt right → bubble moves right
- [ ] Tilt forward/back → bubble moves up/down (Y-axis)
