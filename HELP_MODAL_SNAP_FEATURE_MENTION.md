# Help Modal - Snap Feature Mentions Added

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Change

Added tasteful mentions of the "gentle snap" feature to Distance Mode and Rectangle Mode descriptions, using the word "automagically" to highlight the automatic assistance.

---

## What Was Added

### 1. Distance Mode (Line 492)

**Before:**
```
Measure straight-line distances. Tap to place two points 
and get the distance between them.
```

**After:**
```
Measure straight-line distances. Tap to place two points 
and get the distance between them. A gentle snap keeps 
lines horizontal and vertical automagically!
```

**Why:** Distance lines benefit from horizontal/vertical snapping for precision.

---

### 2. Rectangle Mode (Line 565)

**Before:**
```
Measure rectangular objects. Tap two opposite corners to 
get length and height measurements.
```

**After:**
```
Measure rectangular objects. Tap two opposite corners to 
get length and height measurements. Edges snap to perfect 
horizontal and vertical lines automagically!
```

**Why:** Rectangle edges are always horizontal/vertical, so snap is essential here.

## Why These Two Modes?

### Distance Mode ✅
- **Snap applies:** Yes - snaps to horizontal/vertical
- **User benefit:** Easy to measure walls, floors, straight edges
- **Magic factor:** Lines stay perfectly straight

### Angle Mode ❌
- **Snap applies:** No - angles need freedom
- **Why not mention:** Would be confusing
- **Correct approach:** Let users measure any angle

### Circle Mode ❌
- **Snap applies:** No - circles don't need alignment
- **Why not mention:** Irrelevant to circular measurement
- **Correct approach:** Focus on radius/diameter

### Rectangle Mode ✅
- **Snap applies:** Yes - edges snap to horizontal/vertical
- **User benefit:** Perfect rectangles every time
- **Magic factor:** Edges automatically align

### Freehand Mode ❌
- **Snap applies:** No - free drawing by design
- **Why not mention:** Defeats the purpose
- **Correct approach:** Total freedom for curves

## Word Choice: "Automagically"

**Why this word?**
- ✨ **Playful** - Makes it fun, not technical
- 🪄 **Magical feel** - Highlights the automatic assistance
- 🎯 **Memorable** - Users will remember the feature

- "Intelligently" ❌ Too formal
- "Automagically" ✅ Perfect blend!

## Placement Strategy

### "Gentle Snap" Phrase
- Used for Distance Mode

- Implies helpful, not intrusive

### "Snap to Perfect" Phrase

- Implies accuracy and alignment

### Both Include "Automagically"
