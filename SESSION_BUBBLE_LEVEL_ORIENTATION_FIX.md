# Session Complete: Fixed Bubble Level Orientation

**Date**: October 16, 2025

## Problem Identified

The bubble level on the camera screen was not rotating when the phone was held vertically (portrait orientation). When holding the phone upright, the crosshair remained horizontal with the bubble moving left-right, when it should have rotated 90° to show vertical orientation with the bubble moving up-down.

**Root Cause**: The code correctly detected vertical orientation and adjusted bubble physics, but the crosshair visualization was never rotated to match.

## Solution Implemented

Added rotation animation to the crosshair container that rotates 90° when the phone is detected as being in portrait/vertical orientation.

### Changes Made

#### `/src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`

1. **Line 107**: Added `isVerticalMode` shared value to track phone orientation
   ```typescript
   const isVerticalMode = useSharedValue(false); // Track if phone is vertical
   ```

2. **Line 526**: Update shared value when orientation changes
   ```typescript
   isVerticalMode.value = isVertical; // Update shared value for crosshair rotation
   ```

3. **Lines 748-752**: Added animated rotation style for crosshair container
   ```typescript
   const crosshairContainerStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
     transform: [
       { rotate: isVerticalMode.value ? '90deg' : '0deg' }
     ],
   }));
   ```

4. **Lines 1130-1143**: Changed crosshair container from `View` to `Animated.View` and applied rotation style

5. **Line 1227**: Updated closing tag to `</Animated.View>`

## How It Works

1. **Orientation Detection**: When `beta` (pitch) > 45°, phone is detected as vertical
2. **Shared Value Update**: `isVerticalMode.value` is set to `true`
3. **Crosshair Rotation**: Container rotates 90° smoothly
4. **Bubble Physics**: Bubble continues to move along what appears to be the vertical axis (actually still X-axis, but rotated visually)

## User Experience Improvements

- **Proper Visual Feedback**: Crosshair now matches physical orientation
- **Intuitive Leveling**: Up/down bubble movement when holding phone vertically
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated rotation when switching between horizontal and vertical
- **Consistent Behavior**: Bubble level now works correctly in all orientations

## Testing Recommendations

1. Open camera screen
2. Hold phone flat (horizontal) - verify crosshair is horizontal with 2D bubble movement
3. Rotate phone to vertical (portrait) - verify crosshair rotates 90° and bubble moves up/down only
4. Tilt phone left/right when vertical - verify bubble responds correctly
5. Rotate back to horizontal - verify smooth transition back

## Technical Notes

- The rotation uses Reanimated's `useAnimatedStyle` for smooth 60fps animations
- Orientation threshold is 45° (beta angle) to detect vertical vs horizontal
- Bubble physics remain in X/Y coordinates; only the visual representation rotates
- No performance impact as rotation is GPU-accelerated

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Bubble level now correctly rotates to match phone orientation, showing vertical crosshair when phone is held upright.
