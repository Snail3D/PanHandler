# Layer 3: The Nuclear Option - Disable Touch Responders

## The Situation
We've tried everything and buttons still take forever to respond after gestures. Back to square one.

## What I Just Did
**Completely disabled BOTH touch responder overlays:**
1. Line 2322: Measurement mode overlay (`{false && measurementMode && ...`)
2. Line 2937: Selection mode overlay (`{false && !measurementMode && ...`)

## What This Breaks
- ‚ùå Cannot place measurement points (overlay disabled)
- ‚ùå Cannot select/drag measurements (overlay disabled)
- ‚ùå Freehand drawing won't work

## What This Tests
- ‚úÖ If buttons respond instantly now, we know the touch responders are the culprit
- ‚úÖ If buttons still lag, the problem is somewhere else entirely

## Test Now
1. Take photo, calibrate
2. Switch to Measure mode
3. Try to tap the measure button or any UI button
4. **Does it respond instantly?**

### If Instant:
The touch responders are the problem. We need to rebuild them with:
- Proper gesture exclusion
- No expensive calculations in onResponder handlers
- Maybe use Pressable instead of touch responders

### If Still Slow:
The problem is elsewhere - maybe:
- GestureDetector in ZoomableImage
- React rendering performance
- Something in the menu/button components themselves

**This is the definitive test to find the real bottleneck.** üî¨
