# v2.1.8 - Label Tap Logic Fix

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Problem

User reported a blocking UX issue with tap interactions:

- **Current behavior**: 2 taps on LINE/SHAPE opened the label editor
- **Issue**: This blocked the 4-tap delete gesture workflow
- **Desired**: Labels should only open editor on double-tap of the LABEL itself, not the line/shape

## Solution

### Changes Made

1. **Added Label Tap State** (`DimensionOverlay.tsx` line 259)
   - Created `labelTapState` to track double-tap on labels
   - Similar pattern to existing `tapDeleteState` for consistency

2. **Modified Label Press Handler** (lines 4798-4815)
   - Changed from single-tap to double-tap detection
   - 300ms timeout for double-tap recognition
   - First tap: Light haptic + record timestamp
   - Second tap (within 300ms): Opens label editor + Medium haptic
   - Only responds when NOT in measurement mode

3. **Removed Line/Shape Label Editor** (Previous session)
   - 2-tap label editor already removed from line tap handlers
   - 2-tap label editor already removed from point tap handlers
   - This was completed in the previous session before crash

## Technical Details

**State Addition:**
```typescript
const [labelTapState, setLabelTapState] = useState<{ 
  measurementId: string, 
  lastTapTime: number 
} | null>(null);
```

**Double-Tap Detection Logic:**
```typescript
const handleLabelPress = () => {
  if (!measurementMode) {
    const now = Date.now();
    const TAP_TIMEOUT = 300; // 300ms for double-tap
    
    if (labelTapState?.measurementId === measurement.id && 
        (now - labelTapState.lastTapTime) < TAP_TIMEOUT) {
      // Second tap - open editor
      setLabelEditingMeasurementId(measurement.id);
      setShowLabelEditModal(true);
      Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium);
      setLabelTapState(null);
    } else {
      // First tap - record time
      setLabelTapState({ measurementId: measurement.id, lastTapTime: now });
      Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light);
    }
  }
};
```

## User Experience

### Before:
- 2 taps on line/shape → Opens label editor (blocks delete)
- 1 tap on label → Opens label editor
- 4 taps on line → Delete (but often opens editor instead)

### After:
- 2 taps on LABEL → Opens label editor ✅
- 4 taps on LINE/SHAPE → Deletes measurement ✅
- Line/shape taps no longer interfere with label editing ✅

## Haptic Feedback

- **First tap on label**: Light haptic (tap registered)
- **Second tap on label**: Medium haptic (editor opens)
- Maintains consistency with existing tap patterns

## Files Modified

- `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`
  - Line 259: Added `labelTapState` declaration
  - Lines 4798-4815: Updated `handleLabelPress` with double-tap logic

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Single tap on label does not open editor
- [ ] Double tap on label opens editor
- [ ] 4 taps on line/shape successfully deletes measurement
- [ ] Haptics work correctly (light → medium)
- [ ] Works in both pan and measurement modes

## Notes

- 300ms timeout provides comfortable double-tap window
- Measurement ID tracking prevents cross-measurement tap pollution
- Pattern mirrors existing `tapDeleteState` for maintainability
- Haptic feedback provides clear user confirmation
