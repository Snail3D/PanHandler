# PanHandler v2.2.4 - Quick Reference

**Release Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Focus**: Smart Recalibrate Button Logic

## What Changed

The **Recalibrate button** is now intelligent! It detects what calibration method you used and responds accordingly:

### Old Behavior (v2.2.3 and earlier)
```
Recalibrate button → ALWAYS goes to coin screen
```

### New Behavior (v2.2.4)
```
Map scale only → Reset map + reopen modal (stay in screen)
Coin only → Go to coin screen (unchanged)
Both → Reset both + go to coin screen
```

## Three Scenarios

### 1️⃣ Map Scale ONLY
**Setup:**
- Skip coin calibration (tap "Map" button)
- Set map scale (verbal or blueprint)

**What happens when you tap Recalibrate:**
- ✅ Map scale resets
- ✅ Map scale modal reopens
- ✅ You stay in measurement screen
- ✅ Quick adjustment workflow

**Example:**
```
"Oops, I said the screen is 10cm wide, but it's actually 12cm"
→ Tap Recalibrate
→ Modal opens
→ Enter correct value
→ Lock in
→ Done!
```

### 2️⃣ Calibration ONLY (Coin/Blueprint/Verbal)
**Setup:**
- Complete coin calibration (or blueprint/verbal WITHOUT map scale)

**What happens when you tap Recalibrate:**
- ✅ Goes back to coin calibration screen
- ✅ Clears calibration
- ✅ Clears measurements
- ✅ Original behavior (unchanged)

### 3️⃣ BOTH Calibration AND Map Scale
**Setup:**
- Complete coin calibration
- Then set map scale too

**What happens when you tap Recalibrate:**
- ✅ Resets BOTH calibrations
- ✅ Goes back to coin screen
- ✅ Complete restart
- ✅ Can recalibrate coin, then set map scale again

## Visual Guide

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📐 Verbal scale                    │ ← Calibration Badge
│  10cm = 1km                         │
│  Locked in                          │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │ 🔄 Recalibrate              │   │ ← Smart Button
│  └─────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Tap Recalibrate → Smart logic runs:
  - Map only? → Reopen modal
  - Coin only? → Go to coin screen  
  - Both? → Reset both, go to coin
```

## Technical Details

### Button Appearance Conditions

The Recalibrate button appears when you have:
- ✅ Coin calibration, OR
- ✅ Blueprint calibration, OR
- ✅ Verbal calibration, OR
- ✅ Map scale

**Old code:**
```typescript
{coinCircle && ... // Only showed with coin
```

**New code:**
```typescript
{(coinCircle || calibration || mapScale) && ... // Shows with ANY calibration
```

### Decision Logic

```typescript
if (mapScale && !calibration && !coinCircle) {
  // Scenario 1: Map only
  setMapScale(null);
  setShowMapScaleModal(true);
}
else if (mapScale && (calibration || coinCircle)) {
  // Scenario 2: Both
  setMapScale(null);
  onReset(true); // Go to coin screen
}
else {
  // Scenario 3: Calibration only
  onReset(true); // Go to coin screen
}
```

## Why This Matters

### Problem Before
```
User: Sets map scale (10cm = 1km)
User: "Wait, my screen is 12cm not 10cm"
User: Taps Recalibrate
App: Takes them to coin screen ❌
User: "But I don't have a coin! I just want to fix the 10cm→12cm"
User: Frustrated 😤
```

### Solution Now
```
User: Sets map scale (10cm = 1km)
User: "Wait, my screen is 12cm not 10cm"
User: Taps Recalibrate
App: Reopens map scale modal ✅
User: Changes 10cm → 12cm
User: Locks in
User: "Perfect!" 😊
```

## Common Workflows

### Quick Map Scale Adjustment
1. Working with map scale
2. Realize measurement is wrong
3. Tap "Recalibrate"
4. Modal reopens immediately
5. Fix the value
6. Back to measuring

### Complete Recalibration
1. Have both coin + map scale
2. Want to start completely over
3. Tap "Recalibrate"
4. Both reset
5. Back to coin screen
6. Redo everything fresh

### Standard Coin Recalibration
1. Only have coin calibration
2. Tap "Recalibrate"
3. Back to coin screen
4. Works exactly as before

## Testing Quick Reference

**Test Map Only:**
- Skip coin → Set map scale → Recalibrate
- ✓ Modal should reopen, not go to coin screen

**Test Coin Only:**
- Calibrate coin → Recalibrate
- ✓ Should go to coin screen (unchanged)

**Test Both:**
- Calibrate coin → Set map scale → Recalibrate
- ✓ Should reset both and go to coin screen
