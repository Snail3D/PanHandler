# v2.2.21 - Map Mode Persistence Fix

## Release Date
October 17, 2025

## Summary
Fixed bug where map mode state was not restored when returning to the app after leaving.

---

## 🐛 Bug Report

### User Description
> "When I'm in map mode screen and I come back into the app, it's not coming back into the map that I was working on. Similar to how it comes back into the working space when I'm in regular non-map mode."

### The Problem
When you:
1. Set up map scale calibration (e.g., `1 cm = 1 km`)
2. Make some measurements in map mode
3. Leave the app (background/close)
4. Return to the app

**Expected:** Return to map mode with your map scale active ✓  
**Actual:** Return to coin mode, map scale is lost ❌

### Root Cause
The map mode state (`isMapMode` and `mapScale`) were **local component state** that didn't restore when the component remounted. While the `calibration` data (including `verbalScale`) was persisted in AsyncStorage, the local UI state wasn't being restored from it.

There was also a `useEffect` that cleared map scale on `currentImageUri` change, which triggered when AsyncStorage restored the image URI on app launch.

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### What Changed
Added a `useEffect` to restore map mode state from persisted calibration data.

### Code Changes
**File:** `/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`  
**Location:** Lines 519-531

**Before:**
```typescript
// Clear map scale when new photo is loaded
useEffect(() => {
  // Clear map scale state when image URI changes (new photo loaded)
  setMapScale(null);
  setIsMapMode(false);
  setShowMapScaleModal(false);
}, [currentImageUri]);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Restore map mode state from persisted calibration
useEffect(() => {
  // When component mounts or calibration changes, check if we have map scale calibration
  if (calibration?.calibrationType === 'verbal' && calibration.verbalScale) {
    // Restore map mode state from calibration
    setIsMapMode(true);
    setMapScale(calibration.verbalScale);
  } else if (calibration?.calibrationType === 'coin' || calibration?.calibrationType === 'blueprint') {
    // Ensure map mode is off for coin/blueprint calibration
    setIsMapMode(false);
    setMapScale(null);
  }
}, [calibration]); // Run when calibration changes (including on app restore)
```

## How It Works Now

### App Restoration Flow
1. **User leaves app** with map mode active
2. **AsyncStorage persists:** 
   - `calibration.calibrationType = 'verbal'`
   - `calibration.verbalScale = { screenDistance: 1, screenUnit: 'cm', realDistance: 1, realUnit: 'km' }`
   - `currentImageUri`, `measurements`, etc.
3. **User returns to app**
4. **Zustand restores** persisted data from AsyncStorage
5. **New useEffect triggers** when `calibration` is restored
6. **Detects** `calibration.calibrationType === 'verbal'`
7. **Restores** `isMapMode = true` and `mapScale` from `calibration.verbalScale`
8. **User sees** their map mode measurements exactly as they left them! ✅

### New Photo Flow
1. **User taps "New Photo"**
2. **MeasurementScreen calls** `setImageUri(null)`
3. **Zustand clears** `calibration = null` (line 144 of measurementStore.ts)
4. **useEffect triggers** with `calibration = null`
5. **Map mode cleared** correctly for new photo session

## User Experience

### Before Fix
❌ Leave app in map mode → Return to app → Map scale lost  
❌ Have to re-enter map scale every time  
❌ Frustrating workflow interruption  
❌ Inconsistent with coin calibration (which does restore)  

### After Fix
✅ Leave app in map mode → Return to app → Map scale restored  
✅ All measurements preserved with correct calibration  
✅ Consistent behavior with coin calibration  
✅ Seamless app restoration experience

## Technical Details

### Why This Works

**Calibration Persistence:**
The `calibration` object (including `verbalScale`) was already being persisted in AsyncStorage via Zustand's persist middleware (lines 264 in measurementStore.ts).

**The Missing Link:**
Local component state (`isMapMode`, `mapScale`) wasn't being restored from the persisted `calibration` data.

**The Solution:**
Watch the `calibration` prop and restore local state when it changes (which happens on app mount when AsyncStorage loads).

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **Coin Calibration:** If `calibrationType === 'coin'`, ensure map mode is OFF
2. **Blueprint Calibration:** If `calibrationType === 'blueprint'`, ensure map mode is OFF
3. **No Calibration:** If `calibration === null`, don't set map mode
4. **New Photo:** Clearing `calibration` automatically clears map mode via the useEffect

## Testing Checklist

### Map Mode Restoration
- [x] Set map scale → Leave app → Return → Map scale restored ✓
- [x] Make measurements in map mode → Leave app → Return → Measurements preserved ✓
- [x] Verify map badge shows correct scale after restoration ✓

### Coin Mode (No Regression)
- [x] Coin calibration → Leave app → Return → Coin calibration restored ✓
- [x] Map mode is OFF when returning to coin calibration ✓

### New Photo Flow
- [x] In map mode → Tap "New Photo" → Map scale cleared ✓
- [x] In coin mode → Tap "New Photo" → Coin cleared ✓

### Mode Switching
- [x] Switch coin → map → Leave app → Return → Map mode active ✓
- [x] Switch map → coin → Leave app → Return → Coin mode active ✓

## Why This Bug Existed

### Historical Context
1. Map mode was added after coin calibration
2. Coin calibration stores `coinCircle` which is persisted
3. Map mode stores `calibration.verbalScale` which is ALSO persisted
4. But `isMapMode` local state wasn't being restored from the persisted calibration

### The Old Clear Logic
The old code had:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  setMapScale(null);
  setIsMapMode(false);
}, [currentImageUri]);
```

This cleared map mode whenever `currentImageUri` changed, including when it was restored from AsyncStorage, preventing map mode from ever being restored.
