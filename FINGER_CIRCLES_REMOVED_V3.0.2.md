# Pinch Tutorial - Finger Circles Removed (v3.0.2)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## The Change

**Removed**: White circle finger animations  
**Kept**: All instruction text ("Pinch to Zoom", "Match coin's OUTER edge to the green circle", etc.)

---

## User Request

"Well, I still wanted that animation text. I just didn't want the circles."

---

## What Was Changed

**File**: `src/components/ZoomCalibration.tsx`

### Lines 914-1049 (Restructured)

**Before**: 
- Everything (text + finger circles) was inside `{showTutorial && (` block
- When showTutorial was false, NOTHING showed

**After**:
- Instruction text is ALWAYS visible (moved outside conditional)
- Finger circle animations stay inside `{showTutorial && (` block (never shows since showTutorial=false)

---

## What You'll See Now

### ✅ Always Visible:
- "Pinch to Zoom" heading
- "Match coin's OUTER edge to the [color] circle" 
- "Make sure the right coin is selected.\nSelect the map icon for maps, blueprints or point to point scale measurements"

### ❌ Hidden Forever:
- The 2 white circle finger animations
