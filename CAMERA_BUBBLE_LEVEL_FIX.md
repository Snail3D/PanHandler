# Camera Bubble Level & Auto-Capture Improvements

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

## Summary

Fixed bubble level behavior in vertical orientation and added manual capture button for better UX.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Bubble Level in Vertical Mode
**Issue:** When holding phone vertically (portrait), bubble was tracking left-right tilt instead of forward-backward tilt.

**Fix:** 
- Changed vertical mode to use `beta` (forward/backward) instead of `gamma` (left-right)
- Bubble now only moves UP/DOWN based on forward/backward phone tilt
- X-axis is locked to center (no left-right movement)
- Added 2Â° deadzone for better "snapped to center" feel
- Reduced sensitivity from /15 to /20 for easier alignment
- Increased damping (40), reduced stiffness (100), increased mass (1.5) for smoother movement

**Before:**
```javascript
// Used gamma (left-right) for X movement
const bubbleXOffset = -(gamma / 15) * maxBubbleOffset;
bubbleY locked to 0
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Uses beta deviation from 90Â° for Y movement
const verticalDeviation = beta - 90;
const bubbleYOffset = (adjustedDeviation / 20) * maxBubbleOffset;
bubbleX locked to 0
```

### 2. Added Manual Capture Button
**Issue:** Users didn't know auto-capture was happening, needed explicit action.

**Solution:** Added green "ðŸ“¸ Press Now to Begin" button that appears when:
- Phone is stable (`isStable`)
- Alignment is good (`alignmentStatus === 'good'`)
- Not currently capturing

**Button Features:**
- Beautiful green gradient with glow
- Pressed state animation
- Medium haptic feedback on press
- Uppercase text with camera emoji
- Large touch target (16px vertical padding, 32px horizontal)

## Files Modified

- `/home/user/workspace/src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`
  - Lines 533-562: Fixed vertical mode bubble level to use beta (forward/back) instead of gamma (left/right)
  - Lines 1458-1499: Added manual capture button below instructional text

## Technical Details

### Vertical Mode Bubble Physics
```javascript
if (isVertical) {
  // Calculate deviation from 90Â° (perfect vertical)
  const verticalDeviation = beta - 90;
  
  // 2Â° deadzone for centering
  let adjustedDeviation = verticalDeviation;
  if (Math.abs(verticalDeviation) < 2) {
    adjustedDeviation = 0;
  }
  
  // Gentler sensitivity (/20) and smooth spring physics
  const bubbleYOffset = (adjustedDeviation / 20) * maxBubbleOffset;
  
  bubbleX.value = withSpring(0, { damping: 40, stiffness: 100, mass: 1.5 });
  bubbleY.value = withSpring(bubbleYOffset, { damping: 40, stiffness: 100, mass: 1.5 });
}
```

## User Experience

**Vertical orientation (portrait holding phone):**
- âœ… Bubble only moves up/down (forward/backward tilt)
- âœ… No left/right movement (X locked to center)
- âœ… Smoother, easier to center
- âœ… 2Â° deadzone makes it "snap" to center
- âœ… Reduced sensitivity makes alignment easier

**Manual capture button:**
- âœ… Appears when conditions are perfect
- âœ… Clear call-to-action with emoji
- âœ… Haptic feedback confirms press
- âœ… Works alongside auto-capture (gives user control)

## Testing

- âœ… Test vertical orientation - bubble should only move up/down
- âœ… Test horizontal orientation - bubble should move in all directions (unchanged)
- âœ… Button appears when aligned and stable
- âœ… Button triggers capture correctly
