# Help Modal CAD Workflow Update

## Date: October 13, 2025

## What Changed

Updated the **HelpModal** to better explain the CAD import workflow, specifically highlighting two key features that make importing into CAD software quick and easy.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **CAD Import Guide - Step 3 Updated**

**Before:**
```
Step 3: Set Canvas Scale
Use the scale value shown on the photo to calibrate your canvas
```

**After:**
```
Step 3: Scale Using Coin Reference
Use the coin information in the photo label to quickly scale your canvas in CAD

Quick Scaling: The photo label shows your coin type and size (e.g., "US Quarter - √ò 24.26mm"). 
Use this to set your canvas scale by measuring the coin in the photo!

Alignment Brackets: The 50% opacity image includes corner alignment brackets to make 
positioning in CAD quick and easy
```

**Why:** Users can now understand they can use the coin reference directly in CAD to scale, not just the canvas scale value. This is more intuitive and flexible.

---

### 2. **CAD Import Guide - Step 4 Updated**

**Before:**
```
Trace over the 50% opacity image using your CAD tools. All measurements are perfectly scaled!
```

**After:**
```
Trace over the 50% opacity image using your CAD tools. Use the alignment brackets to position 
the image precisely!
```

**Why:** Explicitly mentions the alignment brackets so users know to look for and use them.

---

### 3. **Save & Share Section Updated**

**Before:**
```
üîß CAD Export - 50% opacity, perfectly scaled
```

**After:**
```
üîß CAD Export - 50% opacity with alignment brackets
```

**Why:** Highlights the alignment brackets feature in the export list.

## User-Reported Screenshots

The user provided two screenshots showing the CAD workflow features:

### Screenshot 1: Alignment Corner Brackets
![Pan/Zoom Mode with corner brackets](https://images.composerapi.com/877A31C4-FF33-4181-9F80-E5A20FFEAA82.jpg)

Shows the corner L-shaped alignment brackets that appear around the Pan/Zoom Mode toast. These brackets help users:
- Align the image precisely in CAD software
- Position the canvas reference quickly
- Ensure proper orientation

### Screenshot 2: Trace & Model Step
![Trace and Model instruction](https://images.composerapi.com/6DF7E483-8237-4252-A1AD-3911631539BB.jpg)

Shows Step 4 explaining:
- Tracing over the 50% opacity image
- Using CAD tools for modeling
- **Key insight:** Users can use the coin information in the photo label to quickly scale the photo in CAD

---

## What These Features Enable

### 1. **Alignment Corner Brackets**
- Appear on the 50% opacity CAD export image
- L-shaped brackets in the corners
- Make it easy to align and position the reference image in CAD software
- Provide visual reference points for orientation

### 2. **Coin Reference in Label**
- Photo label shows coin type and diameter (e.g., "US Quarter - √ò 24.26mm")
- Users can measure the coin in the CAD canvas
- Set canvas scale based on the coin measurement
- Faster and more intuitive than using the pixels-per-unit calculation
- Works with any CAD software that supports canvas images

---

## CAD Import Workflow (Updated)

### Step 1: Open Your CAD Software
Create a new project or open an existing design

### Step 2: Insert Canvas Image
Import the CAD Canvas Photo from PanHandler as a canvas or reference image

### Step 3: Scale Using Coin Reference ‚≠ê NEW
**Option A:** Use the coin in the photo label
- Look at the label on the photo (e.g., "US Quarter - √ò 24.26mm")
- Measure the coin in your CAD canvas
- Set your canvas scale so the coin measures correctly

**Option B:** Use the provided canvas scale value
- If the photo shows "Canvas Scale: 0.0412", enter this in your CAD settings

### Step 4: Trace & Model
- Use the **alignment brackets** to position the image precisely
- Trace over the 50% opacity image
- All measurements are perfectly scaled!

## Technical Details

### Where Are the Alignment Brackets Generated?

The alignment brackets are likely generated during the second email attachment capture in `DimensionOverlay.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line 1402-1418: Second capture with 50% opacity
setHideMeasurementsForCapture(true); // Hide measurements and legend
if (setImageOpacity) setImageOpacity(0.5); // Set 50% opacity

const labelOnlyUri = await captureRef(viewRef.current, {
  format: 'png',
  quality: 1.0,
  result: 'tmpfile',
});
```

The brackets appear to be rendered as part of the UI overlay and are captured in both:
1. Full photo with measurements
2. 50% opacity CAD-ready version

## Files Modified

### `/home/user/workspace/src/components/HelpModal.tsx`

**Lines Updated:**
- **Line 1061:** Step 3 title changed to "Scale Using Coin Reference"
- **Line 1064:** Added explanation about using coin information
- **Line 1067-1072:** Added detailed instructions for quick scaling and alignment brackets
- **Line 1088:** Updated Step 4 to mention alignment brackets
- **Line 854:** Updated Save & Share section to mention alignment brackets

---

## User Impact

### Before
- Users might not know about the alignment brackets
- Users might not realize they can use the coin directly in CAD for scaling
- Documentation focused on the calculated canvas scale value

### After
- Users are explicitly told about alignment brackets and their purpose
- Users understand they can use the coin reference for quick scaling
- Two methods for scaling are now documented (coin-based and value-based)
- CAD workflow is clearer and more actionable

---

## Benefits

1. **More Flexible Workflow** - Users can choose coin-based or value-based scaling
2. **Clearer Instructions** - Alignment brackets are now documented
3. **Better UX** - Users discover features through documentation
4. **Professional Touch** - Shows attention to detail for CAD users
5. **Faster Import** - Users can get started in CAD more quickly

---

## Version Information

**Updated From:** v1.1 Stable (Context-Sensitive Instructions)  
**Current Version:** v1.1 Stable + CAD Workflow Documentation  
**Status:** Ready for use  
**Documentation:** Updated  

---

## Related Documentation

- `README_STABLE_V1.1.md` - Current stable release documentation
- `EMAIL_ATTACHMENT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Email export with 50% opacity feature
- `HelpModal.tsx` - Updated help modal component

## Next Steps

If users request further clarification:
1. Could add visual diagrams showing alignment bracket positions
2. Could add example CAD software screenshots
3. Could add video tutorial links
4. Could expand the "nerdy stuff" section with canvas scaling math
