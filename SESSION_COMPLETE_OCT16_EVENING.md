# Session Summary - October 16, 2025 (Evening)

## Overview
Completed recalibrate button functionality, added privacy/permissions documentation, and polished calibration UI. Fixed critical bug where measurements weren't cleared on recalibration.

---

## Features Completed

### 1. Recalibrate Button - Full Implementation ‚úÖ
**Initial Work** (from previous session summary):
- Added red "Recalibrate" button below calibration badge
- Made it go to calibration screen with same photo (instead of camera)

**Bug Fix** (this session):
- Fixed: Old measurements remained visible after recalibrating
- Now properly clears all measurements and points when recalibrating
- Clean slate for new calibration

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` - Button UI and `onReset(true)` call
- `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx` - Handler with measurement clearing logic

---

### 2. Privacy & Security Section ‚úÖ
Added comprehensive privacy information to Help Modal:
- üì± Photos stay on device (never uploaded)
- ‚úâÔ∏è Email only for sending reports (never shared)
- üëÅÔ∏è Zero tracking/analytics
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Works offline, lightweight

**Files Modified**: `src/components/HelpModal.tsx`

---

### 3. App Permissions Guide ‚úÖ
Added "App Permissions" section to Help Modal:
- Lists required permissions (Camera, Photo Library)
- Clear instructions: "Settings ‚Üí PanHandler ‚Üí Enable Camera & Photos"
- Short and actionable as requested

**Files Modified**: `src/components/HelpModal.tsx`

---

### 4. Calibration Screen UI Polish ‚úÖ

#### Help Button Position Fixed
- **Issue**: Button was way off-screen to the right
- **Fix**: Moved to `right: 70` (was `right: SCREEN_WIDTH * 0.15 + 8`)
- **Result**: Fully visible with proper spacing

#### Coin Selector Enhanced
- **Alternating row colors**: Light white / subtle gray pattern
- **Larger tap targets**: 18px vertical padding (up from 16px)
- **Better visual separation**: 6px margin between rows
- **Improved press states**: Dark highlight on tap
- **Better typography**: Larger, bolder text
- **Taller list**: 280px max height (was 240px)

**Files Modified**: `src/components/ZoomCalibration.tsx`

---

## Bug Fixes

### Recalibrate Measurements Clear Bug ‚úÖ
**Problem**: After tapping Recalibrate, old measurements remained on photo when returning to measurement screen

**Solution**: 
- Added `setCompletedMeasurements([])` to clear all measurements
- Added `setCurrentPoints([])` to clear active drawing points
- Applied to BOTH recalibrate mode and full reset mode

**Impact**: Users now get a clean slate when recalibrating, no confusion from old measurements

---

## Technical Details

### Recalibrate Handler Logic
```typescript
if (recalibrateMode) {
  // Keep photo, clear everything else
  setCoinCircle(null);
  setCalibration(null);
  setMeasurementZoom({ scale: 1, ... });
  setCompletedMeasurements([]); // NEW
  setCurrentPoints([]); // NEW
  setMode('zoomCalibrate');
} else {
  // Full reset to camera
  // Clear all state including photo
}
```

### Coin List Alternating Colors
```typescript
backgroundColor: index % 2 === 0 
  ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)'  // Light (even rows)
  : 'rgba(240, 240, 245, 0.85)', // Darker (odd rows)
```
