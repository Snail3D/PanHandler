# v2.2.25 - Map Mode Calibration Validation

## Release Date
October 17, 2025

## Summary
Added validation to prevent measurements in map mode without calibration, with helpful alert message.

---

## üéØ Feature Request

### User Description
> "Once the user gets into map mode and they don't have a coin calibration set, when they go to place a line, they shouldn't be able to place that line. A pop-up should come up and say 'Place calibration first.' Then have an icon to the map and the control center. Just say 'Tap map button to set scale.'"

### What Changed
Added a validation check when user tries to place a measurement in map mode without having set the map scale.

---

## How It Works

### Before Fix
‚ùå User enters map mode  
‚ùå Taps to place measurement  
‚ùå No calibration set  
‚ùå Measurement placed anyway (with wrong/no scale)  
‚ùå Confusing and incorrect  

### After Fix
‚úÖ User enters map mode  
‚úÖ Taps to place measurement  
‚úÖ No calibration set  
‚úÖ **Alert appears:** "Set Map Scale First"  
‚úÖ **Message:** "Tap the Map button in the menu to set your map scale before measuring."  
‚úÖ **Haptic:** Warning feedback  
‚úÖ **Result:** No measurement placed, user knows what to do

## Alert Details

### Title
**"Set Map Scale First"**

### Message
**"Tap the Map button in the menu to set your map scale before measuring."**

### Icon/Type
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** (yellow alert icon)

### Haptics
**Warning notification** - Distinct "something's wrong" feel

### User Action
- Tap "OK" to dismiss
- Look for Map button in bottom menu
- Tap Map button ‚Üí Set scale
- Return to measurement mode with calibration set

---

## When Validation Triggers

### Condition
```typescript
if (isMapMode && !mapScale) {
  // Show alert, prevent measurement
}
```

### Scenarios

**Scenario 1: New Map Photo**
1. Take photo of map
2. Tap "Map" in calibration screen
3. Don't set scale yet
4. Try to place measurement
5. ‚úÖ **Alert appears**

**Scenario 2: Cancelled Map Scale**
1. In map mode with scale set
2. Recalibrate and cancel
3. Now in map mode but no scale
4. Try to place measurement  
5. ‚úÖ **Alert appears**

**Scenario 3: Map Mode Without Setup**
1. Somehow enter map mode (edge case)
2. No map scale exists
3. Try to place measurement
4. ‚úÖ **Alert appears**

## Technical Details

### File Modified
`/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` - `onResponderGrant` handler (lines 3144-3153)

### Code Added
```typescript
// CHECK: If in map mode without calibration, show alert
if (isMapMode && !mapScale) {
  showAlert(
    'Set Map Scale First',
    'Tap the Map button in the menu to set your map scale before measuring.',
    'warning'
  );
  Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Warning);
  return; // Prevent any measurement placement
}
```

### Why onResponderGrant?
- First touch event when user taps screen
- Before cursor appears
- Before any measurement logic runs
- Perfect place for validation
- Early return prevents all downstream processing

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Clear Guidance
‚úÖ **Explicit title** - "Set Map Scale First"  
‚úÖ **Clear instructions** - "Tap the Map button..."  
‚úÖ **Actionable** - User knows exactly what to do  

### Prevents Errors
‚úÖ No measurements with incorrect scale  
‚úÖ No confusion about why measurements look wrong  
‚úÖ No need to delete and redo measurements  

### Consistent with Design
‚úÖ Uses existing `showAlert()` modal system  
‚úÖ Warning type (yellow) appropriate for preventable error  
‚úÖ Haptic feedback matches alert severity  

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Coin Mode ‚Üí Map Mode
- User has coin calibration
- Switches to map mode
- No map scale set
- ‚úÖ Alert prevents measurement

### Case 2: Map Scale ‚Üí Recalibrate ‚Üí Cancel
- User had map scale
- Recalibrates, then cancels
- Still in map mode but scale cleared
- ‚úÖ Alert prevents measurement

### Case 3: Quick Taps
- User rapidly taps screen multiple times
- Each tap shows alert (with debouncing from modal system)
- ‚úÖ Prevents measurement spam

---

## Alternative Implementations Considered

### Option 1: Auto-Open Map Scale Modal ‚ùå
**Why not:** Too aggressive, interrupts user flow

### Option 2: Disable Measurement Tools ‚ùå
**Why not:** Less clear why tools are disabled

### Option 3: Gray Out UI ‚ùå
**Why not:** Harder to implement, less obvious

### Option 4: Alert with Guidance ‚úÖ
**Why yes:** 
- Clear communication
- Non-intrusive (one alert, not repeated)
- Actionable instructions
- Uses existing UI patterns

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Validation
- [x] Map mode without scale ‚Üí Tap screen ‚Üí Alert appears ‚úì
- [x] Alert has correct title and message ‚úì
- [x] Warning haptic feedback ‚úì
- [x] No measurement placed after dismissing alert ‚úì

### After Setting Scale
- [x] Dismiss alert ‚Üí Set map scale ‚Üí Return to measurement ‚úì
- [x] Tap screen ‚Üí Cursor appears (no alert) ‚úì
- [x] Place measurement ‚Üí Works correctly ‚úì

### Edge Cases
- [x] Coin mode ‚Üí Map mode without scale ‚Üí Alert ‚úì
- [x] Map scale set ‚Üí Recalibrate+cancel ‚Üí Alert ‚úì
- [x] Freehand mode also blocked ‚Üí Alert ‚úì

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Quick action button** in alert - "Set Scale Now" ‚Üí Opens map scale modal
2. **Tutorial highlight** - Highlight Map button after dismissing alert
3. **Remember preference** - If user dismisses 3x, stop showing (advanced users)
4. **Visual indicator** - Show "No Scale" badge in map mode

### Not Needed Now
The current implementation is clear and sufficient. Users will understand quickly.
