## [Alpha v1.0] - 2025-10-14

### 🎉 Alpha Release - Production Ready

#### ✨ Major Features
- **Combined Coin Calibration Screen** - Unified coin selection + zoom calibration (was 2 separate screens)
- **Map Scale Mode** - Measure from maps, blueprints, drawings with known scales
- **5 Measurement Tools** - Distance, Angle, Circle, Rectangle, Freehand (Pro)
- **Dynamic Color System** - Each measurement gets unique vibrant color
- **CAD Export** - DXF format with precise coordinates (Pro feature)
- **Comprehensive Help System** - 11 expandable sections with rolodex animation
- **Offline & Lightweight** - No internet required, minimal storage

#### 🎨 UI/UX Polish
- Watery glassmorphic design throughout
- "LOCK IN" button consistency (calibration + map scale)
- Unit selector color differentiation (Blue=Metric, Red=Imperial)
- Help icon positioning (moved diagonally inward 20%)
- Label modal improvements (darker text, bigger save button, "Leave Blank")
- Free vs Pro comparison (X icon with dark background)
- Coin border visibility (10% darker opacity)
- Offline/Lightweight badges in Help Modal

#### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Flash behavior simplified (torch on/off, no complex logic)
- Pan-to-Measure tap bug fixed (simultaneousWithExternalGesture)
- Lock/Unlock confusion resolved (removed unlock state)
- Help Modal z-index bug fixed (expanded sections stay on top)
- Zoom calibration circle 30% bigger (better accuracy)
- Back button 2× bigger (more obvious)
- Coin change button 15% bigger
- Save button 10% bigger (icon + text)

#### 🧮 Mathematical Foundation
- Coin calibration: `pixelsPerMM = (referenceRadiusPixels * 2 / zoomScale) / coinDiameterMM`
- Distance: `realWorldDistance = √[(x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²] / pixelsPerUnit`
- Angle: `angleDegrees = acos(dotProduct / (mag1 * mag2)) * 180/π`
- Circle: `area = π * radius²`, `circumference = 2π * radius`
- Rectangle: `area = width * height`, `perimeter = 2(w + h)`
- Freehand: Shoelace algorithm for area, perimeter summation

#### 📱 Export System
- Email with annotated image + measurement data
- Save to Photos with measurements burned in
- CAD export (DXF format) - Pro feature
- Labels for measurements (optional)

#### 🎯 Gesture System
- Pan - Move/edit measurements or image
- Pinch - Zoom image
- Tap - Place measurement points
- Long press - Magnified cursor (precision)
- Swipe - Cycle modes, hide menu
- Shake - Toggle menu visibility

#### 💰 Monetization
- Free tier: Unlimited measurements, coin calibration, all tools except freehand
- Pro ($9.97 one-time): Freehand tool, CAD export, zoom upgrades
- No subscriptions, lifetime access

## Development History

### October 14, 2025 - Final Polish Session
- Combined coin selection + zoom calibration into one screen
- Added "LOCK IN" consistency across screens
- Fixed pan-to-measure tap responsiveness
- Added unit selector color differentiation
- Improved label modal contrast and sizing
- Enhanced help modal (z-index fix, offline badges)
- Fixed coin border visibility
- Removed lock/unlock toggle complexity
- Simplified flash behavior

### Earlier Development (Pre-Alpha)
- Core measurement algorithms implemented
- Calibration system designed
- UI/UX foundation established
- Export system built
- Help system created
- Pro features gated
- Gesture handlers implemented

## 🐛 Known Issues (None Critical)

### Minor
- Some unused imports flagged by TypeScript (cleanup needed)
- Deprecated ImageManipulator API (still works, update later)

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Apple Watch calibration concept
- [ ] Batch measurement mode
- [ ] Measurement templates
- [ ] Cloud sync (optional)
- [ ] AR measurement mode (iOS 17+)
