## [Alpha v2.1.7] - 2025-10-17

### 🎯 Freehand Snap to Existing Points

#### ✨ Enhancement
- **Freehand Can Now Snap to Measurement Points** - Connect freehand to polygons and other shapes
  - **Start Point Snap**: When starting freehand near existing point (~10px) → snaps to it
  - **Mid-Draw Snap**: While drawing, if you approach existing point → snaps to it
  - Allows connecting freehand curves to polygon corners, rectangle edges, etc.
  - Same snap behavior as distance lines (1mm tight snap)
  - Heavy haptic feedback when snap occurs
  - Foundation for future shape merging functionality
  
#### 🎯 Use Cases
- Start freehand from polygon corner (precise connection)
- Draw freehand curve that connects to rectangle edge
- Extend existing shapes with organic freehand curves
- Create complex hybrid shapes (straight + curved lines)

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Start point snap check when `prevPath.length === 0`
- Mid-draw snap check when `prevPath.length >= 3`
- Uses existing `snapToNearbyPoint()` function (1mm threshold)
- Prevents duplicate points (>0.5px distance requirement)
- Only snaps if closer than raw cursor position

#### 📝 Note
- Shapes remain separate measurements (for now)
- Future update will add automatic merging (combined perimeter/area/color)
- Snap functionality needs field testing before adding merge logic

#### 📁 Files Modified
- `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` - Freehand snap logic (lines 3276-3290, 3345-3372)
- `app.json` - Version bump to 2.1.7

- **Reduced Snap Threshold for Fluid Movement** - Rectangle/point adjustment now smooth instead of chunky
  - Snap distance when moving: 7mm → **0.5mm** (14x tighter!)
  - Pixel snap radius: ~70px → **~5px** (dramatic reduction)
  - Movement feels smooth and fluid, not blocky
  - Still snaps for alignment, but only when VERY close to another point
  - Applies to all point dragging: rectangles, polygons, distance, angle
  
#### 🎯 User Experience
- **Before**: Chunky, blocky movement with huge "magnetic" snap zones
- **After**: Smooth, fluid movement with pinpoint snap accuracy
- Snap still helps with alignment when needed
- Natural, predictable behavior

#### 🔧 Technical Changes
- `SNAP_DISTANCE_MM` for moveMode: 7 → 0.5
- Fallback snap pixels: 60 → 5

## [Alpha v1.0] - 2025-10-14

### 🎉 Alpha Release - Production Ready

#### ✨ Major Features
- **Combined Coin Calibration Screen** - Unified coin selection + zoom calibration (was 2 separate screens)
- **Map Scale Mode** - Measure from maps, blueprints, drawings with known scales
- **5 Measurement Tools** - Distance, Angle, Circle, Rectangle, Freehand (Pro)
- **Dynamic Color System** - Each measurement gets unique vibrant color
- **CAD Export** - DXF format with precise coordinates (Pro feature)
- **Comprehensive Help System** - 11 expandable sections with rolodex animation
- **Offline & Lightweight** - No internet required, minimal storage

#### 🎨 UI/UX Polish
- Watery glassmorphic design throughout
- "LOCK IN" button consistency (calibration + map scale)
- Unit selector color differentiation (Blue=Metric, Red=Imperial)
- Help icon positioning (moved diagonally inward 20%)
- Label modal improvements (darker text, bigger save button, "Leave Blank")
- Free vs Pro comparison (X icon with dark background)
- Coin border visibility (10% darker opacity)
- Offline/Lightweight badges in Help Modal

#### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Flash behavior simplified (torch on/off, no complex logic)
- Pan-to-Measure tap bug fixed (simultaneousWithExternalGesture)
- Lock/Unlock confusion resolved (removed unlock state)
- Help Modal z-index bug fixed (expanded sections stay on top)
- Zoom calibration circle 30% bigger (better accuracy)
- Back button 2× bigger (more obvious)
- Coin change button 15% bigger
- Save button 10% bigger (icon + text)

#### 🧮 Mathematical Foundation
- Coin calibration: `pixelsPerMM = (referenceRadiusPixels * 2 / zoomScale) / coinDiameterMM`
- Distance: `realWorldDistance = √[(x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²] / pixelsPerUnit`
- Angle: `angleDegrees = acos(dotProduct / (mag1 * mag2)) * 180/π`
- Circle: `area = π * radius²`, `circumference = 2π * radius`
- Rectangle: `area = width * height`, `perimeter = 2(w + h)`
- Freehand: Shoelace algorithm for area, perimeter summation

#### 📱 Export System
- Email with annotated image + measurement data
- Save to Photos with measurements burned in
- CAD export (DXF format) - Pro feature
- Labels for measurements (optional)

#### 🎯 Gesture System
- Pan - Move/edit measurements or image
- Pinch - Zoom image
- Tap - Place measurement points
- Long press - Magnified cursor (precision)
- Swipe - Cycle modes, hide menu
- Shake - Toggle menu visibility

#### 💰 Monetization
- Free tier: Unlimited measurements, coin calibration, all tools except freehand
- Pro ($9.97 one-time): Freehand tool, CAD export, zoom upgrades
- No subscriptions, lifetime access
