Also, let’s make the menu zip up on the side of the screen similar to how YouTube or a another app or even this app the menu button you can slide it into the screen or side and it kind of makes it disappear so we can have the menu sort of where you can just kind of fling it into the side and it goes into a little arrow with a little bar almost like a little tab on the side that you can move up and down the side of the screen and you can put it on both sides. I’ll attach a screenshot of what the arrow looks like. That’s the placeholder for YouTube.
