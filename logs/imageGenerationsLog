I think all that can be rearranged. It's probably too much information now up at the top. The "Retake" and "Recalibrate" can probably be in the menu if it needs to be, but I think it's superfluous. So that whole menu bar up at the top can probably go away."\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/399A96D3-21B8-4F1D-9D52-F070535AD910.jpg\n\n[2025-10-12T01:49:16.909Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: "The menu transparency is still not ideal. Also, I think the menu can still be another 20% smaller overall I like a more classy kind of transparent look almost like you’re looking not through frosted glass but through like a puddle or you’re looking through a water droplet, kind of thing. Also, let’s make the menu zip up on the side of the screen similar to how YouTube or a another app or even this app the menu button you can slide it into the screen or side and it kind of makes it disappear so we can have the menu sort of where you can just kind of fling it into the side and it goes into a little arrow with a little bar almost like a little tab on the side that you can move up and down the side of the screen and you can put it on both sides. I’ll attach a screenshot of what the arrow looks like. That’s the placeholder for YouTube. Something like that would be nice but we’re getting close."\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/EC2D2A9B-3D58-48AF-8469-8C05E2BF8565.jpg\n\n
