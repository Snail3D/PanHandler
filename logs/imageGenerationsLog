I just keep thinking the first time users are going to put it to the inside of the circle or mess it up and then it’s not gonna be accurate. You know what I Mean? But at the same time, I don’t wanna be annoying to past users. I just want them to glide right through that helper screen like they already are. Maybe we could even have the edge of the circle pulse as the instruction comes up to mash to the edge of the circle and then have it pulse the edge pulse something like that what do you think? You know what another big brain idea if it seems like somebody’s doing the same measurement in the same area over and over again like they keep like it seems like they keep trying to remeasure something if that makes sense like they keep doing my new adjustments and trying to measure something. Can there be a little helper when you come up in the same sexy classy you know theme and aesthetic that we already have going on can you come up and say does are your measurements off? Check your check your coin in your calibration your coin settings in your calibration something like that and then they can click anywhere off. They can click anywhere and it’ll the menu will go off gracefully and I don’t want it to come up often so I dont want it to be too sensitive to when somebody’s trying just normally to nail the right spot. It looks like you know two or three times that they’ve tried to go in the same spot. I want there to be some logic there to be fairly intuitive and not be annoying to people. What do you think real quick let’s plan this out. What do you think we can do for that? Any ideas? Oh 0, and definitely if they click off of it for that session or that photo don’t remind them again because they’ll already know to check I don’t want this to be a persistent notice just every time they bring in a new photo and they seem like they’re trying to measure that place you know 2 or 3 times then yeah. But think about it like this like let’s say they sit down a circle and then a couple of seconds later they changed the circle just slightly and then you see it go back. It’s like OK.
