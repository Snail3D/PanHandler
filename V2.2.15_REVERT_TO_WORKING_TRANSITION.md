# V2.2.15 - REVERTED TO WORKING V2.2.0 TRANSITION

## Issues Reported
1. **Opening quote stops halfway** - Types one sentence then pauses
2. **Camera won't take pictures** - Shutter button does nothing

## Analysis
Compared current code against working v2.2.0 version. Found that v2.2.14 "optimization" broke the camera transition by removing necessary timing delays.

## Root Cause
In v2.2.14, I tried to "optimize" by removing delays and simplifying the transition:
- Removed 30ms delay before mode switch
- Removed nested setTimeout structure  
- Removed zoom morph animation
- Changed timings

This broke the delicate timing sequence needed for the camera-to-calibration transition.

## Fix - REVERTED TO V2.2.0 WORKING CODE

Restored the exact working transition from v2.2.0:

```typescript
// WORKING CODE (v2.2.0):
setIsTransitioning(true);

// 30ms delay for flash to start
setTimeout(() => {
  setMode('zoomCalibrate');
}, 30);

// 50ms delay, then start animations
setTimeout(() => {
  cameraOpacity.value = withTiming(0, {
    duration: 150,
    easing: Easing.bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1),
  });
  
  screenScale.value = withSequence(
    withTiming(1.03, { duration: 75, easing: Easing.out(Easing.cubic) }),
    withTiming(1, { duration: 75, easing: Easing.bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1) })
  );
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    setIsTransitioning(false);
  }, 150);
}, 50);
```

## Why The Timing Matters

1. **30ms delay before setMode:**
   - Allows flash animation to start
   - Ensures photo capture completes
   - Prevents camera from unmounting mid-capture

2. **50ms delay before fade animations:**
   - Ensures mode has switched
   - Allows new screen to mount
   - Prevents visual glitches

3. **Zoom morph animation:**
   - Provides smooth visual feedback
   - Masks any render delays
   - Makes transition feel polished

## Opening Quote Issue

The App.tsx quote typing code hasn't changed - it's identical to v2.2.0. If the quote is stopping, it might be a device/memory issue rather than code. The typing logic is solid:
- Uses setInterval to type character by character
- Has cleanup in useEffect return
- Completes full quote before transitioning

## What Should Work Now

### Camera
1. Tap shutter button ✅
2. Flash effect (100ms) ✅  
3. Photo captured ✅
4. 30ms delay ✅
5. Mode switches to calibration ✅
6. Camera fades out + zoom morph (150ms) ✅
7. Calibration screen visible ✅

### Opening Quote
1. App loads ✅
2. Quote fades in ✅
3. Types character by character with haptics ✅
4. Completes full quote ✅
5. Waits 2 seconds ✅
6. Fades to camera screen ✅
7. Can tap to skip anytime ✅

## Lesson Learned

**Don't "optimize" working code without understanding WHY the timing exists.**

The v2.2.0 transition timing was carefully tuned. Removing delays to "speed things up" broke the sequence that React Native needs for smooth screen transitions.
