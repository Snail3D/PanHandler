## üö® CACHE ISSUE - SAME AS BEFORE

The render error you're seeing is from **cached JavaScript**. The code is fixed with these updates:

### Fixed Issues:
1. ‚úÖ Touch array handling (line 1428-1438) - extra defensive
2. ‚úÖ Tetris message updated and centered
3. ‚úÖ Undo long-press auto-stops when empty
4. ‚úÖ Cache-bust comment added to force reload

### To See Changes:
**The Vibecode system auto-manages the dev server.** The easiest way to see the new code:
1. Close the Vibecode app preview
2. Reopen it

Or shake device ‚Üí "Reload"

The JavaScript bundle needs to refresh to load the new code!

## Tetris Easter Egg Details:

**Trigger:** Fill legend to ~70% of screen height (~59 measurements)

**Animation Sequence:**
1. 30 colorful Tetris blocks fall from top
2. They stack at bottom (getting faster = "runaway Tetris")
3. ~6 seconds: blocks pile up
4. **CENTER MESSAGE APPEARS:** "WE CAN PLAY GAMES TOO ;) / You're starting fresh"
5. Red "GAME OVER" box appears
6. ~8 seconds: Screen fades to black
7. All measurements cleared (but stays calibrated!)
8. Can trigger again if you make ~59 more measurements

**Design Philosophy:**
- Playful surprise for power users
- Shows personality ("we can play games too")
- Clears measurements so you start fresh
- Doesn't lose calibration (that would be mean!)
- One-time per session (won't re-trigger until restart)

**The code is EPIC and ready - just needs the JS bundle to reload!** üöÄ
