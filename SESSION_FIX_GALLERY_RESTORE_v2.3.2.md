# Gallery Import Fix - Restored Working Version v2.3.2

## Issue
After my "fix", gallery import showed a black screen instead of the photo type modal.

## Root Cause
I incorrectly tried to transition to measurement mode before showing the modal. The PhotoTypeSelectionModal is rendered at the ROOT level (outside mode checks), so it works fine from camera mode - it just needed to be shown directly.

## Solution
Restored the working version from commit `0c53c15` which:
- Calls `setImageUri()` directly
- Shows `setShowPhotoTypeModal(true)` immediately
- NO mode transitions needed
- Modal appears over camera mode perfectly

## The Working Pattern

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT (from commit 0c53c15):
const pickImage = async () => {
  // ... permission checks ...
  const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({...});
  
  if (!result.canceled && result.assets[0]) {
    const asset = result.assets[0];
    
    setImageUri(asset.uri, false); // Set image
    await detectOrientation(asset.uri);
    
    // Show modal directly - NO mode transition!
    setPendingPhotoUri(asset.uri);
    setShowPhotoTypeModal(true); // ✅ Works from camera mode!
  }
};
```

## Why It Works
The `PhotoTypeSelectionModal` is rendered at line 2408-2414 in the return statement, OUTSIDE of any mode checks, so it appears over whatever mode you're in.

## Files Changed
- `/home/user/workspace/src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx` (lines 1466-1570)
- Restored from git commit `0c53c15`

## Status
✅ Gallery import should now work - modal appears immediately, no black screen

## Lesson Learned
Check git history when something "used to work" - the working version had the answer all along!
