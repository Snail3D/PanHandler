# v3.0.1 Code Changes - Wall Photo Modal Fix

## Files Modified: 2

---

## 1. src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx

### Change #1: Lines 1180-1189 (Wall photo capture path)

**BEFORE (v3.0 - BROKEN)**:
```typescript
// Store pending photo
setPendingPhotoUri(photo.uri);

// Small delay then show modal (stay in camera mode!)
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('🔴 Setting showPhotoTypeModal to TRUE');
  setShowPhotoTypeModal(true);
  
  // Defer storage write (MMKV is fast but still defer to not block modal)
  setTimeout(() => {
    // setImageUri already clears measurements/calibration/coinCircle in one write
    setImageUri(photo.uri, wasAutoCapture);  // ❌ THIS CAUSES RE-RENDER BOMB
    __DEV__ && console.log('✅ Deferred storage write complete (wall photo)');
  }, 200);
}, 100);
```

**AFTER (v3.0.1 - FIXED)**:
```typescript
// Store pending photo
setPendingPhotoUri(photo.uri);

// Small delay then show modal (stay in camera mode!)
// DON'T call setImageUri here - it causes massive re-render that breaks modal
// Instead, setImageUri is called in handlePhotoTypeSelection AFTER user picks
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('🔴 Setting showPhotoTypeModal to TRUE');
  setShowPhotoTypeModal(true);  // ✅ CLEAN - No blocking writes
}, 100);
```

### Change #2: Lines 1415-1471 (handlePhotoTypeSelection function)

**BEFORE (v3.0 - BROKEN)**:
```typescript
const handlePhotoTypeSelection = (type: PhotoType) => {
  setShowPhotoTypeModal(false);
  setCurrentPhotoType(type);
  
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium);
  
  // COIN: Go to calibration screen for coin calibration
  if (type === 'coin') {
    // ... transition code ...
  }
  // ALL OTHER TYPES: Skip calibration, go straight to measurement screen
  else {
    // ... transition code ...
  }
};
```

**AFTER (v3.0.1 - FIXED)**:
```typescript
const handlePhotoTypeSelection = (type: PhotoType) => {
  setShowPhotoTypeModal(false);
  setCurrentPhotoType(type);
  
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium);
  
  // ✅ NOW write the pending photo to storage (was previously done before modal, causing re-render bug)
  // pendingPhotoUri is set in the wall photo path (line 1181)
  if (pendingPhotoUri) {
    setImageUri(pendingPhotoUri, false); // false = not auto-captured since user had to choose
    setPendingPhotoUri(null); // Clear pending
  }
  
  // COIN: Go to calibration screen for coin calibration
  if (type === 'coin') {
    // ... transition code ...
  }
  // ALL OTHER TYPES: Skip calibration, go straight to measurement screen
  else {
    // ... transition code ...
  }
};
```

**Key Addition**: Lines 1421-1426 now write to storage AFTER modal is dismissed

## 2. app.json

### Change: Line 6 (Version bump)

**BEFORE**:
```json
"version": "2.7.0",
```

**AFTER**:
```json
"version": "3.0.1",
```

## Summary of Changes

| File | Lines | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| MeasurementScreen.tsx | 1180-1189 | Removed setImageUri call, added explanatory comment |
| MeasurementScreen.tsx | 1421-1426 | Added pendingPhotoUri check + setImageUri call |
| app.json | 6 | Version 2.7.0 → 3.0.1 |

**Total lines added**: 8  
**Total lines removed**: 7  
**Net change**: +1 line

## Why This Works

1. **Modal shows immediately** - No blocking MMKV writes before modal render
2. **User interaction completes** - User sees modal → makes choice → modal dismisses
3. **Storage write at safe time** - setImageUri called during mode transition when re-render is expected
4. **No race conditions** - Linear flow: capture → show modal → user picks → write → transition

---

## Testing

All paths tested:
- ✅ Wall photo → Coin calibration
- ✅ Wall photo → Map mode
- ✅ Wall photo → Blueprint mode
- ✅ Table photo → Auto coin (unchanged, different code path)

Performance:
- Modal appears in ~100-150ms (was: never)
- No freezing
- Smooth transitions
- Instant user feedback

**This fix is complete and ready for deployment.** ✅
