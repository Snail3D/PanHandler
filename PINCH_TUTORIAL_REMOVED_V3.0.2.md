# Pinch Tutorial Animation Removed ✅

## Version: 3.0.2
## Date: Continued from v3.0.1 session

---

## The Change

Removed the pinching finger animation that appeared in the bottom right corner of the Zoom Calibration screen.

### User Feedback
"There's still some little pinching animation that's happening that needs to go away."

### Why It Was There
The code had a comment saying "Show tutorial animation (always, since it's pretty!)" - it was intentionally showing every time, ignoring the `hasSeenPinchTutorial` flag.

---

## What Was Removed

**File**: `src/components/ZoomCalibration.tsx`

### Lines 266-325 (The Tutorial Logic)

**Before**: 
- Tutorial would show every time user entered calibration
- 2 animated white circles (representing fingers) would pinch in/out
- Animation ran 3 times over 7 seconds
- Included text overlays and arrows

**After**:
- Tutorial completely disabled
- No animations on calibration screen start
- Clean, unobstructed view

---

## The Code Change

**Before (lines 266-325)**:
```typescript
// Show tutorial animation (always, since it's pretty!)
useEffect(() => {
  initialZoomScale.current = zoomScale;
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    setShowTutorial(true);
    
    // Fade in coin selection text + arrow first
    coinTextOpacity.value = withSpring(1, { damping: 20 });
    arrowOpacity.value = withSpring(1, { damping: 20 });
    
    // [... 50+ lines of animation code ...]
    
  }, 800);
}, []);
```

**After (lines 266-270)**:
```typescript
// Pinch tutorial disabled - users know how to pinch!
useEffect(() => {
  initialZoomScale.current = zoomScale;
  // Tutorial animations removed per user request
}, []);
```

---

## What Still Works

- ✅ Coin circle overlay (green/blue/etc)
- ✅ "Pinch to Zoom" text at bottom
- ✅ Instruction text about matching coin edge
- ✅ Coin selector
- ✅ Lock In button
- ✅ All calibration functionality

**Only removed**: The 2 animated white finger circles

---

## Visual Impact

**Before**: 
- White circles pinching in bottom right
- Lasted 7 seconds
- Repeated 3 times
- Could be distracting

**After**:
- Clean screen
- Just the colored coin circle overlay
- No animations
- Professional look

---

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/ZoomCalibration.tsx**
   - Lines 266-325: Removed tutorial animation logic
   - Replaced with empty useEffect (just sets initialZoomScale)

---

## Testing

- [x] Enter calibration screen → No pinch animation
- [x] Coin circle still visible
- [x] Instructions still visible
- [x] Can still zoom and calibrate normally
- [x] Lock In button still works

---

**Status**: Complete ✅

The pinch tutorial animation is now completely gone from the Zoom Calibration screen.
