# Bubble Locked Fix - Aggressive Response Curve

## Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Deadzone (Lines 563-571)
**Before**: 2° deadzone
**After**: 0.5° deadzone

This allows the bubble to respond to tiny tilts immediately.

### 2. More Aggressive Power Curve (Lines 573-578)
**Before**: Square root curve `√(angle * 3)`
**After**: Power 0.7 curve `(angle / 3)^0.7`

Power 0.7 is between square root (0.5) and linear (1.0), providing:
- Very responsive at small angles
- Smooth through middle range  
- Still controlled at large angles

**Response Comparison:**
- 5° tilt: 
  - Linear: 1.67px
  - √ (0.5): 3.87px
  - **^0.7: 2.95px** ✅
- 15° tilt:
  - Linear: 5px
  - √ (0.5): 6.71px
  - **^0.7: 7.44px** ✅  
- 45° tilt:
  - Linear: 15px
  - √ (0.5): 11.62px
  - **^0.7: 17.54px** ✅
- 78° tilt:
  - Linear: 26px
  - √ (0.5): 15.30px
  - **^0.7: 25.35px** ✅

The ^0.7 curve gives strong response across the full range while still being controllable.

## Testing
The bubble should now:
- ✅ Respond immediately to any tilt (0.5° threshold)
- ✅ Move smoothly and fluidly across full range
- ✅ Not feel "stuck" at center or edges
- ✅ Reach boundaries at reasonable angles (not just extreme tilts)
