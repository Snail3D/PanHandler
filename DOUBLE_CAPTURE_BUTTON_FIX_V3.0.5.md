# Double-Capture Shutter Button Bug - FIXED ‚úÖ (v3.0.5)

**Date**: Oct 20, 2025  
**Status**: RESOLVED

---

## The Bug

When taking a wall photo (vertical/upright orientation), the shutter button remained clickable **while the photo type selection modal was displayed**. Users could see flashes in the background when pressing the button multiple times, causing:
- Multiple photo captures
- Confusing UX (why is the button still working?)
- Potential race conditions and performance issues

**User Report**: "During that time, the modal is up, the selection modal actually comes up, but I'm still able to click on the button again because I can see a flash in the background."

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The shutter button visibility was controlled by:
```javascript
{!isCapturing && (
  <Pressable onPressOut={() => { /* takePicture() */ }} />
)}
```

This **hides** the button when `isCapturing = true`. However, there was a critical flaw in the `takePicture()` function:

```javascript
// OLD CODE - BUG!
const takePicture = async () => {
  try {
    setIsCapturing(true);
    
    // Take photo...
    
    if (isLookingAtTable) {
      // Table photo: Switch to calibration mode
      setMode('zoomCalibrate');
    } else {
      // Wall photo: STAY in camera mode, show modal
      setShowPhotoTypeModal(true);
    }
  } finally {
    setIsCapturing(false); // ‚ùå ALWAYS resets, even for wall photos!
  }
}
```

**The Race Condition**:
1. User presses shutter ‚Üí `isCapturing = true` ‚Üí button hidden ‚úÖ
2. Photo captured (takes ~100-500ms)
3. **Wall photo path**: Stay in camera mode, show modal
4. **`finally` block runs** ‚Üí `setIsCapturing(false)` ‚ùå
5. Button becomes visible again **while modal is still open** ‚ùå
6. User can press button again ‚Üí Multiple captures!

### Why Table Photos Worked Fine

Table photos immediately switched to `'zoomCalibrate'` mode, so even though `isCapturing` was reset, the button wouldn't render because we were no longer in camera mode.

But wall photos **stayed in camera mode** while showing the modal, so the button would reappear!

---

## The Fix

### 1. Conditionally Reset `isCapturing` Based on Photo Path

**Table Photo (Auto Coin)**: Reset immediately since we're leaving camera mode
```javascript
if (isLookingAtTable) {
  // Table photo: Switch to calibration
  setCapturedPhotoUri(photo.uri);
  setIsTransitioning(true);
  setMode('zoomCalibrate');
  
  // ‚úÖ Reset isCapturing since we're leaving camera mode
  setIsCapturing(false);
}
```

**Wall Photo (Modal)**: Keep `isCapturing = true` to prevent double-capture
```javascript
else {
  // Wall photo: STAY in camera mode, show modal
  
  // ‚úÖ IMPORTANT: Keep isCapturing = true to prevent double-capture
  // It will be reset when user selects from modal or cancels
  
  setPendingPhotoUri(photo.uri);
  setTimeout(() => {
    setShowPhotoTypeModal(true);
  }, 100);
}
```

### 2. Remove the `finally` Block

```javascript
// OLD CODE
} finally {
  setIsCapturing(false); // ‚ùå Always resets
}

// NEW CODE
}
// ‚úÖ No finally block - isCapturing is reset conditionally:
// - Table photo: reset immediately (we leave camera mode)
// - Wall photo: stay true until user selects from modal
```

### 3. Reset When User Interacts with Modal

**On Selection**:
```javascript
const handlePhotoTypeSelection = (type: PhotoType) => {
  setShowPhotoTypeModal(false);
  setCurrentPhotoType(type);
  
  // ‚úÖ Reset isCapturing since user has made their selection
  setIsCapturing(false);
  
  // ... proceed with selected type
}
```

**On Cancel**:
```javascript
<PhotoTypeSelectionModal
  visible={showPhotoTypeModal}
  onSelect={handlePhotoTypeSelection}
  onCancel={() => {
    setShowPhotoTypeModal(false);
    // ‚úÖ Reset isCapturing so user can take another photo
    setIsCapturing(false);
    // Clear the pending photo since user cancelled
    setPendingPhotoUri(null);
  }}
/>
```

## Files Modified

**src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx**:
1. **Line 1134**: Added `setIsCapturing(false)` in table photo path
2. **Line 1171-1172**: Added comment explaining why we keep `isCapturing = true` for wall photos
3. **Lines 1237-1239**: Removed `finally` block, added explanatory comment
4. **Line 1410**: Added `setIsCapturing(false)` in `handlePhotoTypeSelection`
5. **Lines 2265-2271**: Added `setIsCapturing(false)` and `setPendingPhotoUri(null)` in modal cancel handler

## Testing Checklist

‚úÖ **Table Photo** (horizontal, phone flat):
1. Press shutter ‚Üí Photo captured
2. Immediately transitions to calibration
3. Button disappears (mode changes)
4. Cannot double-capture ‚úÖ

‚úÖ **Wall Photo** (vertical, phone upright):
1. Press shutter ‚Üí Photo captured
2. Modal appears immediately
3. Button is HIDDEN (isCapturing = true) ‚úÖ
4. Try pressing where button was ‚Üí No flash, no capture ‚úÖ
5. Select "Coin" ‚Üí Modal closes, button stays hidden during transition ‚úÖ
6. Cancel modal ‚Üí Modal closes, button reappears for new photo ‚úÖ

‚úÖ **Error Handling**:
1. If capture fails ‚Üí `isCapturing` reset in catch block ‚úÖ
2. User can retry immediately ‚úÖ

## State Flow Diagram

### Table Photo Flow
```
Press Shutter
  ‚Üì
isCapturing = true (button hidden)
  ‚Üì
Photo captured
  ‚Üì
isCapturing = false ‚Üê Reset immediately
mode = 'zoomCalibrate' (button won't render anyway)
  ‚Üì
Done ‚úÖ
```

### Wall Photo Flow
```
Press Shutter
  ‚Üì
isCapturing = true (button hidden)
  ‚Üì
Photo captured
  ‚Üì
isCapturing = true ‚Üê STAY true!
mode = 'camera' (still in camera mode)
showPhotoTypeModal = true
  ‚Üì
User selects OR cancels
  ‚Üì
isCapturing = false ‚Üê Reset now
  ‚Üì
Done ‚úÖ
```

## Key Insights

1. **`isCapturing` is UI state, not just operation state** - It controls button visibility, so it must stay true until the user's interaction flow is complete
2. **Modal interactions require button lockout** - Even though technically the capture is done, the user shouldn't be able to start a new capture until they finish with the modal
3. **Different photo paths need different state management** - Table vs wall photos have fundamentally different flows
4. **`finally` blocks are dangerous for UI state** - They run no matter what, which can reset state prematurely
