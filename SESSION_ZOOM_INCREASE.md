# Session Complete: Increased Pinch Zoom to 25x

**Date**: October 16, 2025

## What Was Completed

### Increased Maximum Pinch Zoom
Updated both ZoomableImage components to allow 25x zoom instead of the previous 20x limit.

## Changes Made

### `/src/components/ZoomableImageV2.tsx`
- **Line 100**: Changed max scale from `20` to `25`
- This is the primary component used on the calibration/measurement screen

### `/src/components/ZoomableImage.tsx`
- **Line 37**: Changed max scale from `20` to `25`
- Updated for consistency across all zoomable components

## Technical Details

**Before**:
```typescript
scale.value = Math.max(1, Math.min(savedScale.value * event.scale, 20));
```

**After**:
```typescript
scale.value = Math.max(1, Math.min(savedScale.value * event.scale, 25));
```

## User Experience Improvements

- **Better Precision**: Users can now zoom in 25% more than before
- **Calibration Accuracy**: More detailed view when placing coin circles
- **Measurement Precision**: Clearer view of measurement points and edges
- **Flexibility**: Extra zoom headroom for fine-tuning

## Testing Recommendations

1. Open the app and take/load a photo
2. Use two-finger pinch gesture to zoom in
3. Verify you can now zoom to 25x (previously stopped at 20x)
4. Test on calibration screen when placing coin reference
5. Test on measurement screen when adjusting points

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Maximum zoom increased from 20x to 25x on both calibration and measurement screens.
