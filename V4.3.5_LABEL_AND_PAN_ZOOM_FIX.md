# ✅ v4.3.5 - Label Double-Tap AND Pan/Zoom Both Working

## 🐛 The Problem

The previous bot changed `pointerEvents="none"` to `pointerEvents="box-none"` on the main View container (line 5284) to make labels tappable for editing. This broke pan/zoom gestures.

**The Dilemma:**
- `pointerEvents="none"` → Pan/Zoom works ✅, Labels NOT tappable ❌
- `pointerEvents="box-none"` → Labels tappable ✅, Pan/Zoom broken ❌

## 💡 The Solution

**Wrap ONLY the interactive label Pressables in a separate View with `pointerEvents="box-none"`** while keeping the parent View at `pointerEvents="none"`.

### How It Works:

```tsx
{/* Main SVG overlay - pointerEvents="none" allows pan/zoom gestures to pass through */}
<View ref={viewRef} pointerEvents="none">
  <Svg>
    {/* All measurement drawings */}
  </Svg>
  
  {/* NEW: Interactive labels wrapper */}
  <View pointerEvents="box-none">
    {/* Label Pressables here - can receive taps */}
    <Pressable onPress={handleLabelTap}>...</Pressable>
  </View>
</View>
```

## 🎯 Result

✅ **Pan/Zoom gestures work** - Parent View with `pointerEvents="none"` doesn't block them  
✅ **Label double-tap works** - Child View with `pointerEvents="box-none"` allows Pressables to receive taps  
✅ **All label types supported:**
- Distance line labels
- Angle labels
- Circle labels
- Rectangle side labels (Width/Height)
- Freehand/Lasso labels
- Polygon labels

## 📝 Changes Made

**File:** `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`

**Lines 5450-5451:** Added opening wrapper View
```tsx
{/* Interactive labels wrapper - allows tapping labels while parent View has pointerEvents="none" for pan/zoom */}
<View style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0 }} pointerEvents="box-none">
```

**Lines 5754-5755:** Added closing wrapper View
```tsx
</View>
{/* End interactive labels wrapper */}
```

## 🔍 What This Wraps

The wrapper View contains:
1. **Main labels** (lines 5453-5636): Distance, Angle, Circle, Freehand, Polygon
2. **Rectangle side labels** (lines 5638-5752): Width (H:) and Length (L:) labels

## 🎓 Technical Explanation

### `pointerEvents` Prop Behavior:

- **`"none"`** - Component AND children don't receive touch events (events pass through)
- **`"box-none"`** - Component itself doesn't receive touches, but CHILDREN can
- **`"auto"`** - Component and children receive touches normally

### Why This Solution Works:

1. Parent View (`pointerEvents="none"`) lets pan/zoom gestures from `ZoomableImageV2` work
2. Child wrapper View (`pointerEvents="box-none"`) doesn't block gestures but allows its children (Pressables) to work
3. Pressables have `pointerEvents={measurementMode ? "none" : "auto"}` to be interactive only in edit mode
