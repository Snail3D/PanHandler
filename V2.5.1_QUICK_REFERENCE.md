# v2.5.1 Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed
✅ Users can now pan/zoom before placing blueprint pins
✅ Modal stays visible with instructions during adjustment
✅ Blueprint/Known Scale workflow significantly improved

## The Problem
When entering Known Scale mode, the placement modal blocked all touches. Users couldn't pan or zoom the image to position it before placing reference pins.

## The Solution
**Converted Modal to Positioned View**

Before:
```typescript
<Modal visible={visible}>  // Blocked ALL touches
  <View pointerEvents="box-none">
    {/* content */}
  </View>
</Modal>
```

After:
```typescript
<View 
  pointerEvents="box-none"  // Passes touches through
  style={{ position: 'absolute', zIndex: 100 }}
>
  {/* content */}
</View>
```

## Key Technical Insight
- React Native `Modal` creates a **separate window layer** that blocks touches
- Even with `pointerEvents="box-none"` inside, the Modal window itself blocks
- Solution: Use positioned `View` instead + `pointerEvents="box-none"`
- Touches on empty space → pass through to image
- Touches on modal card → captured by buttons

## How pointerEvents="box-none" Works
- Container **ignores** touches
- Children **can capture** touches
- Result: Pan/zoom works, buttons work!

## Files Changed
- `src/components/BlueprintPlacementModal.tsx` - Modal → View conversion
- `app.json` - Version 2.5.0 → 2.5.1

## User Experience
**Before**: Modal appeared, screen locked, had to guess pin placement
**After**: Modal appears, can pan/zoom freely, place pins accurately

## Status
✅ Fixed and tested
✅ Ready for production
✅ Significantly better UX for Known Scale mode
