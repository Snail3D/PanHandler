# Freehand Recalibration Support (v2.5.10)

## Issue
In v2.5.9, the recalibration display fix only worked for distance, angle, circle, rectangle, and polygon measurements. **Freehand paths were not being recalculated** when the user recalibrated with a new blueprint scale/unit.

## Root Cause
The `recalculateMeasurement` function only had a case for `mode === 'freehand' && measurement.isClosed` (closed loops), but was missing support for **regular open freehand paths**.

### Code Structure Before Fix
```typescript
if (mode === 'distance') { ... }
else if (mode === 'angle') { ... }
else if (mode === 'circle') { ... }
else if (mode === 'rectangle') { ... }
else if (mode === 'freehand' && measurement.isClosed) { ... } // Only closed loops!
else if (mode === 'polygon') { ... }
return measurement; // Freehand open paths fall through unchanged
```

## Solution
Expanded the freehand case to handle **both open and closed paths**:

```typescript
else if (mode === 'freehand') {
  // Handle BOTH open and closed paths
  if (measurement.isClosed) {
    // Closed loop - connect back to start
    // Calculate perimeter, clear area
  } else {
    // Open path - regular line
    // Calculate total length
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### File: `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` (Lines ~1633-1682)

**Added logic to:**
1. Check if freehand path is closed or open
2. Calculate total length appropriately:
   - **Closed**: Loop through points with `(i + 1) % points.length` to connect back to start
   - **Open**: Loop from point 1 to end without connecting back
3. Apply calibration conversion using `activeCalibration.pixelsPerUnit`
4. Format with `formatMeasurement()` using the new calibration unit
5. Update the `value` field with the recalculated length

### Calculation Logic

**Open Path:**
```typescript
for (let i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
  const dx = points[i].x - points[i - 1].x;
  const dy = points[i].y - points[i - 1].y;
  totalLength += Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}
```

**Closed Loop:**
```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
  const p1 = points[i];
  const p2 = points[(i + 1) % points.length]; // Wraps back to start
  totalLength += Math.sqrt(
    Math.pow(p2.x - p1.x, 2) + Math.pow(p2.y - p1.y, 2)
  );
}
```

## Testing Checklist
✅ Distance measurements recalibrate correctly  
✅ Angle measurements recalibrate correctly  
✅ Circle measurements recalibrate correctly  
✅ Rectangle measurements recalibrate correctly  
✅ **Freehand open paths recalibrate correctly** (NEW)  
✅ Freehand closed loops recalibrate correctly  
✅ Polygon measurements recalibrate correctly  

## Related Issues
- v2.5.9: Fixed recalibration display for most tools (but missed freehand)
- v2.5.10: Completed the fix by adding freehand support

## Technical Notes
- The function signature still uses `Measurement` type, but actually works with `CompletedMeasurement` objects
- Map mode scaling is also supported for freehand recalibration
- For closed loops, area is cleared during recalibration (perimeter remains valid)

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` - Added freehand case to `recalculateMeasurement()`
2. `app.json` - Version bumped to 2.5.10

## Version History
- v2.5.9: Recalibration display fix (partial - missed freehand)
- v2.5.10: Freehand recalibration support added ✅ **Current**

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All measurement tools now recalibrate correctly
