# BattlingBots Modal - Final Improvements ✨

## Changes Made

### 1. 🚫 Removed Server Cost Mentions
**Changed from**: "Servers cost money" / "Keep servers running"
**Changed to**: "Hundreds of hours of work" / "Months of development"

**Why**: No actual server costs, focus on time investment instead

#### Updated Lines:
- Conversation 3: "Snail spent MONTHS building this... Hundreds of hours."
- Feature list: "Hundreds of hours of work!" (instead of "Support keeps servers running!")
- Donor conversations: Removed server mentions

### 2. 💬 Added Donation Fatigue Conversations
Added new conversation (Conversation 0) addressing donation burnout:

```
"I know... everyone begs these days."
"Yeah. It's exhausting."
"But this guy actually built something."
"Months of work. No ads. No paywall."
"...if ANY app deserves it, it's this one."
```

Also updated Conversation 8 and 10 to acknowledge donation fatigue.

### 3. 🎨 Made Button HIGHLY Visible
**Problem**: White/light button on white background (invisible!)

**Solution**: Changed to GREEN button with high contrast
- **Color**: `#10B981` (emerald green) instead of blue
- **Border**: 2px green border (`#34D399`)
- **Larger**: 20px padding (was 18px)
- **Bigger text**: 19px, weight 800 (was 18px, 700)
- **Better shadow**: Larger, more prominent
- **Larger icon**: 24px coffee icon (was 22px)

**Result**: Button now POPS against the white background! 🟢

### 4. ✨ Improved "Maybe Later" Button
- Added subtle background: `rgba(120,120,128,0.08)`
- Added border: 1px gray border for definition
- Darker text: `#6B7280` (was `#8E8E93`)
- More padding: 16px vertical (was 14px)

- ❌ "Support keeps servers running!"
