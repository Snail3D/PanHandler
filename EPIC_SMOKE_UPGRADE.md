# ðŸ”¥ THE EPIC REVEAL: It Was The SVG Smoke All Along

## The Bottleneck Found
When switching between Pan/Measure modes, React re-renders the entire 6172-line DimensionOverlay component.

This includes line 3739:
```typescript
{measurements.map((measurement, idx) => {
```

### What's Inside This Map?
**For EVERY measurement, it renders 15-30+ SVG elements with glow effects:**

Distance measurement (lines 3748-3770):
- 2 glow layers (strokeWidth 12px + 8px)  
- 1 main line
- 2 end caps
- **10 circles** (5 glow layers per point Ã— 2 points)
= **15 SVG elements per distance measurement**

Angle measurement: **20+ SVG elements**
Circle measurement: **10+ SVG elements**  
Rectangle measurement: **20+ SVG elements** (4 corners Ã— 5 layers each)
Freehand: **Hundreds of path segments**

### The Killer
ALL of these call `imageToScreen()` to transform coordinates on EVERY render!

With just 5 measurements = **75-100 SVG elements** being reconciled.
With 10 measurements = **150-200 SVG elements**.

## Why It's Slow
1. User taps Pan/Measure button
2. `setMeasurementMode()` triggers
3. React re-renders entire 6172-line component
4. `.map()` recalculates ALL measurements
5. `imageToScreen()` called dozens of times
6. React reconciles 100+ SVG elements
7. **10-15 second freeze**

## The Fix
Memoize the measurement rendering so it only updates when measurements actually change, not on every mode switch.

**It wasn't gestures, touch responders, or haptics. It was the beautiful glow SVG effects! ðŸŒŸðŸ’¨**
