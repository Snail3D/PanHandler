# V2.2.2 - Blueprint Pin Placement Uses Measurement Cursor System

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

## Problem
Blueprint pin placement was using direct tap instead of the existing measurement cursor system (press → cursor appears above finger → release to place). This made it inconsistent with distance/angle/circle tools.

### Original Broken Implementation
- User tapped "PLACE PINS NOW" button
- Separate touch overlay at z-index 30 captured direct taps
- Points placed immediately on touch without cursor
- Instructional text overlay showed "Tap to place first point"
- Did NOT use the measurement mode cursor system

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Modified `onResponderRelease` Handler** (Line 3733)
Added blueprint placement logic to the main measurement touch responder:
```typescript
// Blueprint placement mode
if (isPlacingBlueprint) {
  // Convert screen position to image coordinates for blueprint points
  const imageCoords = screenToImage(cursorPosition.x, cursorPosition.y);
  const newPoint = { x: imageCoords.x, y: imageCoords.y };
  const updatedPoints = [...blueprintPoints, newPoint];
  setBlueprintPoints(updatedPoints);
  
  // Haptic feedback
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Heavy);
  
  // If we've placed 2 points, show distance input modal
  if (updatedPoints.length === 2) {
    setIsPlacingBlueprint(false);
    setMeasurementMode(false);
    setShowCursor(false);
    setTimeout(() => {
      setShowBlueprintDistanceModal(true);
    }, 100);
  }
}
```

#### 2. **Added Gray Cursor for Blueprint Mode** (Line 4346)
Created blueprint-specific cursor with gray colors:
```typescript
{/* Blueprint cursor (gray) */}
{showCursor && isPlacingBlueprint && (() => {
  const cursorColor = 'rgba(100, 100, 100, 0.8)';
  const glowColor = 'rgba(150, 150, 150, 0.6)';
  
  // Same cursor structure as regular modes
  // Shows "Place first point" / "Place second point"
})()}
```

#### 3. **Updated Regular Cursor Condition** (Line 4407)
Modified to exclude blueprint mode:
```typescript
{showCursor && mode !== 'freehand' && !isPlacingBlueprint && (() => {
  // Regular colored cursor for distance/angle/circle/rectangle
})()}
```

#### 4. **Removed Separate Touch Overlay** (Previously line 6788-6813)
Deleted the conflicting touch overlay that captured direct taps at z-index 30

#### 5. **Removed Instructional Text Overlay** (Previously line 6815-6846)
Deleted the black box instructional text - now using cursor helper box instead

#### 6. **Fixed Blueprint Points to Use Image Coordinates** (Line 6791)
Updated visualization to convert image coordinates back to screen:
```typescript
{blueprintPoints.map((point, idx) => {
  const screenPoint = imageToScreen(point.x, point.y);
  // Draw gray circles at screenPoint coordinates
})}
```

## New User Flow

1. User taps "Map Scale" → "Blueprint" in VerbalScaleModal
2. BlueprintPlacementModal appears with "PLACE PINS NOW" button
3. User taps "PLACE PINS NOW"
4. **Measurement mode activates** → Gray cursor appears in center
5. User press-and-holds → cursor appears above finger (gray crosshairs)
6. User releases → **First point placed** (gray dot appears)
7. Gray cursor reappears with "Place second point"
8. User press-and-holds → cursor above finger
9. User releases → **Second point placed** (gray line connects)
10. BlueprintDistanceModal appears → user enters distance
11. User taps "LOCK IN" → Calibration saved

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
- Blueprint points stored in **image coordinates** (like all measurements)
- Visualization converts to screen coordinates using `imageToScreen()`
- Compatible with zoom/pan since coordinates are image-based

### Visual Design
- Gray cursor: `rgba(100, 100, 100, 0.8)`
- Gray glow: `rgba(150, 150, 150, 0.6)`
- Gray points and line during placement
- Fade-out animation after "LOCK IN"

### Cursor States
- **Before placement**: Gray cursor, "Place first point"
- **After first point**: Gray cursor, "Place second point"  
- **After second point**: Measurement mode exits, distance modal shows

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Gray cursor appears when blueprint placement starts
- [ ] Press-and-hold shows cursor above finger
- [ ] Release places first gray point
- [ ] Cursor reappears for second point
- [ ] Second release places point and shows line
- [ ] Distance modal appears after second point
- [ ] "LOCK IN" saves calibration correctly
- [ ] Points stay in correct position when zooming/panning
- [ ] Badge shows "10cm between points" (or entered distance)
- [ ] "Map Scale" button toggles map mode on/off

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`
   - Added blueprint handling in `onResponderRelease` (line 3733)
   - Added gray blueprint cursor (line 4346)
   - Updated regular cursor condition (line 4407)
   - Removed separate touch overlay

- Gray visual theme differentiates from regular measurements
- No more confusing direct tap behavior
- Helper text integrated into cursor (not separate overlay)
