# Session Complete - v2.5.9: Recalibration Display Fix

## Issue Resolved
**Bug**: After recalibrating measurements (changing blueprint scale/unit), the display values didn't update automatically. Users had to toggle between metric/imperial units to see the recalibrated values.

## Solution Implemented
Fixed by resetting the `prevUnitSystemRef` after recalibration to force the display update useEffect to run on the next render cycle.

### How It Works
1. When recalibration completes, new calibration is stored
2. All measurements are recalculated with new calibration values
3. Measurements are updated in store via `setMeasurements()`
4. **NEW**: `prevUnitSystemRef.current = null` forces the display update
5. Next render, the useEffect recalculates and displays with new calibration

### Why This Fix Works
The component has a useEffect that watches for unit system and measurement changes. It has an early exit:
```typescript
if (prevUnitSystemRef.current === unitSystem) {
  return; // Don't recalculate if unit system hasn't changed
}
```

Before the fix, recalibration would update measurements but the display wouldn't refresh because the unit system hadn't changed, causing the early exit.

After the fix, setting `prevUnitSystemRef.current = null` ensures the early exit condition fails (`null !== 'metric'`), forcing a display recalculation with the new calibration.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
1. **`src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`** (Line ~7385-7404)
   - Added `prevUnitSystemRef.current = null` after measurement recalculation
   - Added logging for debugging
   - Removed unnecessary setTimeout wrapper

2. **`app.json`**
   - Version bumped: `2.5.8` â†’ `2.5.9`

## Testing Checklist
âœ… Take a photo  
âœ… Calibrate with blueprint (e.g., 10cm scale)  
âœ… Create measurements  
âœ… Recalibrate with different scale (e.g., 5in scale)  
âœ… Verify measurements immediately update with new calibration  
âœ… No need to toggle metric/imperial to see changes  

## Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: useEffect early exit prevented display update after recalibration
- **Fix Type**: State synchronization via ref manipulation
- **Risk Level**: Low (leverages existing mechanism, no new state)
- **Performance Impact**: None (same number of calculations)

## Documentation Created
- `RECALIBRATION_DISPLAY_FIX_V2.5.9.md` - Detailed technical documentation

## Version History
- v2.5.8: Imperial miles support
- v2.5.9: Recalibration display fix âœ… **Current**

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **COMPLETE** - Ready for testing on device

**Next Steps for User:**
1. Test the recalibration flow on your device
2. Verify measurements update immediately after recalibration
3. Check that unit toggling still works as expected
4. Report any issues if the display still doesn't update
