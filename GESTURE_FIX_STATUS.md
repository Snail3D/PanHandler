# Current Status - Gesture Fix

## What We Fixed
Changed rotation and pinch gestures from `.enabled(true)` to `.enabled(!locked)` in ZoomableImageV2.tsx

## New Problem
User reports "freezes up when I try and place" measurements.

## Why This Happens
The lock logic in MeasurementScreen.tsx:
```typescript
const isPanZoomLocked = measurements.length > 0 || currentPoints.length > 0;
```

This locks as soon as you start placing points (`currentPoints.length > 0`), which now disables rotation/pinch immediately.

## Need to Clarify: When Should Gestures Be Available?

### Option A: Never Lock (Always Allow Pan/Zoom/Rotate)
```typescript
const isPanZoomLocked = false;
```
- Users can always adjust view
- May accidentally move image while measuring
- Simple solution

### Option B: Lock Only After Measurements Complete
```typescript
const isPanZoomLocked = measurements.length > 0;
```
- Can pan/zoom while placing active measurement
- Locks after measurement completes
- Middle ground

### Option C: Complex State Machine
- Pan mode: gestures enabled
- Measure mode: gestures disabled
- Requires passing measurementMode from DimensionOverlay to MeasurementScreen
- Most complex

## Question for User
**When should you be able to pan/zoom/rotate the image?**
1. Always? (even while measurements exist)
2. Only while placing a new measurement?
3. Never once measurements exist?
