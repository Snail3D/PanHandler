# ðŸŒ™ STABLE BUILD - 2:30 AM Session

**Timestamp:** 2:30 AM  
**Status:** âœ… All systems working great  
**Mood:** Really really liking where we're at right now

## Major Fixes Completed This Session

### 1. **Freehand Lasso Snap Sensitivity** âœ…
- **Problem:** Snap-to-close was WAY too sensitive (~1cm away would trigger)
- **Solution:** Changed from 15 fixed pixels to **2mm real-world distance**
- **Result:** Much less jumpy, feels like a proper lasso tool now
- **Code:** Uses `calibration.pixelsPerUnit` for accurate real-world distance

### 2. **Color Sync Bug** âœ…
- **Problem:** Measurement label colors didn't match line colors (intermittent)
- **Root Cause:** Labels used filtered array index (excluding rectangles), lines used original array index
- **Solution:** Preserve `originalIdx` through the filter chain
- **Result:** Colors now ALWAYS match between labels and lines perfectly

### 3. **Calibrated Badge Enhancement** âœ…
- **Added:** Coin name and diameter below "Calibrated" text
- **Format:** "US Quarter â€¢ 24.3mm"
- **Purpose:** Quick reference to catch calibration mistakes

### 4. **Mode Button Reordering** âœ…
- **New Order:** Box â†’ Circle â†’ Angle â†’ **Distance** â†’ **Freehand**
- **Result:** Freehand now all the way on the right with PRO badge
- **Distance** is directly left of Freehand

### 5. **Pro/Free Toggle Bug Fix** âœ…
- **Problem:** `resetExportLimits()` error when fast-tapping watermark for testing
- **Solution:** Removed call to deleted function (export limits removed in paywall overhaul)

### 6. **Freehand Area Invalidation** âœ…
- **Problem:** Area stayed in legend after moving freehand points (inaccurate)
- **Solution:** Always clear `area` when any freehand point is moved
- **Result:** Perimeter still updates correctly, area disappears (as it should)
