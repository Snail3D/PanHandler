# Rotation Gesture Debounce Fix

## Issue
Menu buttons became unresponsive after performing rotation gestures. The user observed that rotation (not just panning) was the primary cause of button sticking.

## Root Cause
The `Gesture.Rotation()` handler in `ZoomableImageV2.tsx` was holding onto touch events even after the gesture ended, preventing immediate interaction with menu buttons in `DimensionOverlay.tsx`.

## Solution: 50ms Debounce Cooldown
Implemented a debounce strategy that adds a 50ms cooldown period after gestures complete:

### Changes Made
1. **Added shared value flag**: `gestureJustEnded` to track cooldown state
2. **Created helper function**: `clearGestureCooldown()` that clears the flag after 50ms
3. **Updated rotation gesture**: Added debounce in both `onEnd()` and `onFinalize()` callbacks
4. **Updated pan gesture**: Also added debounce for consistency (pan+rotate often happen together)

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Shared value for cooldown flag
const gestureJustEnded = useSharedValue(false);

// Helper function (must be regular JS for runOnJS)
const clearGestureCooldown = () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    gestureJustEnded.value = false;
    __DEV__ && console.log('ðŸ”“ Gesture cooldown cleared - buttons responsive');
  }, 50);
};

// Rotation gesture with debounce
const rotationGesture = Gesture.Rotation()
  .onEnd(() => {
    // ... save rotation state ...
    gestureJustEnded.value = true;
    runOnJS(clearGestureCooldown)();
  })
  .onFinalize(() => {
    // ... safety backup ...
    gestureJustEnded.value = true;
    runOnJS(clearGestureCooldown)();
  });
```

## Why This Works
- **Timing-based solution**: Gives the gesture handler 50ms to fully release internal state
- **Non-invasive**: Doesn't modify gesture composition or z-index layering
- **Dual safety**: Clears cooldown in both `onEnd` and `onFinalize` to handle edge cases
- **User-imperceptible**: 50ms is fast enough that users won't notice the delay

## Testing
Test by:
1. Rotating the image with 2 fingers
2. Immediately trying to tap menu buttons
3. Buttons should now respond instantly (after 50ms cooldown)

## Key Files Modified
- `src/components/ZoomableImageV2.tsx` - Added debounce to rotation and pan gestures

## Session Context
- Previous attempts (Layer 3 zIndex, pointerEvents, aggressive cleanup) all failed
- User's observation about rotation being the culprit was the key insight
- Option D (Debounce Strategy) from the previous session's plan was successful
