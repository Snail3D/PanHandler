**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

## Overview
Fixed calibration screen UI issues and added permissions guide to Help Modal.

---

## 1. Help Button Position Fixed ‚úÖ

### Problem
- Help button was positioned way off-screen to the right
- Formula: `right: SCREEN_WIDTH * 0.15 + 8` pushed it out of view
- Users couldn't access help during calibration

### Solution
- Repositioned to standard top-right corner: `right: 16`
- Adjusted top position: `insets.top + 16` (was `insets.top + 28`)
- Enhanced styling with better shadow and background opacity
- Now visible and accessible during calibration

### Files Modified
**`src/components/ZoomCalibration.tsx`** (lines 571-610)
- Changed position from `right: SCREEN_WIDTH * 0.15 + 8` to `right: 70`
- Changed top from `insets.top + 28` to `insets.top + 16`
- Improved background opacity: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)` (was 0.35)
- Added shadow for better visibility

### Visual Changes
**Before**:
- Help button: Off-screen (too far right)
- Not visible to users

**After**:
- Help button: Top-right corner, clearly visible
- Proper spacing from edge (70px) - enough room to breathe
- Enhanced contrast and shadow
- Fully visible, not cut off by screen edge
