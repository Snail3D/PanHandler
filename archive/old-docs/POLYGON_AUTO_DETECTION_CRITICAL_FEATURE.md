# 🔷 POLYGON AUTO-DETECTION - CRITICAL FEATURE

## ⚠️ DO NOT REMOVE THIS FEATURE ⚠️

This is a **core feature** that users rely on. It has been accidentally removed multiple times. This document ensures it stays working.

---

## What It Does

**Automatically detects when 3+ distance lines form a closed polygon and merges them into a single polygon with area calculation.**

### User Flow:
1. User calibrates with coin
2. User switches to **Distance** mode
3. User draws 3+ distance lines that connect to form a closed shape (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.)
4. **AUTOMATICALLY**: When the last line closes the loop (endpoints within 20px), the app:
   - Detects the closed polygon
   - Merges all connected lines into one polygon
   - Calculates perimeter + area
   - Plays success haptic
   - Shows in legend as: `"18.5 ft (A: 25.3 ft²)"`
   - Assigns new color

---

## Implementation Details

### File: `/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`

#### Function Location: ~Line 1700

```typescript
const detectAndMergePolygon = (allMeasurements: Measurement[]) => {
  const SNAP_TOLERANCE = 20; // pixels - how close endpoints need to be
  
  // Only check distance measurements
  const distanceLines = allMeasurements.filter(m => m.mode === 'distance');
  
  // Need at least 3 lines to form a polygon
  if (distanceLines.length < 3) return;
  
  // ... 175 lines of polygon detection logic ...
}
```

#### Function Call Location: ~Line 1680 (after placing distance measurement)

```typescript
// Inside placePoint() function, after creating a distance measurement:
if (mode === 'distance') {
  detectAndMergePolygon([...measurements, newMeasurement]);
}
```

---

## Critical Requirements

### ✅ Must Have:
1. **Function `detectAndMergePolygon()`** must exist in `DimensionOverlay.tsx` (~175 lines)
2. **Function must be called** after each distance line is placed
3. **SNAP_TOLERANCE = 20 pixels** (how close endpoints must be to connect)
4. **Mode type `'polygon'`** must exist in:
   - `MeasurementMode` type definition (line ~30)
   - `MEASUREMENT_COLORS` object (line ~33-75)
   - `CompletedMeasurement` type in store (line ~27 in measurementStore.ts)

### Algorithm:
1. Filter for distance lines only
2. For each line, try to build a connected chain by finding adjacent lines
3. Check if chain forms closed loop (first point connects to last point within 20px)
4. If closed:
   - Extract all points in order
   - Calculate perimeter (sum of line lengths)
   - Calculate area using **Shoelace formula**
   - Create new `polygon` or `freehand` measurement with `isClosed: true`
   - Remove individual lines
   - Add merged polygon to measurements
   - Play success haptic

---

## Type Definitions Required

### In `DimensionOverlay.tsx`:
```typescript
type MeasurementMode = 'distance' | 'angle' | 'circle' | 'rectangle' | 'freehand' | 'polygon';
```

### In `measurementStore.ts`:
```typescript
export interface CompletedMeasurement {
  mode: 'distance' | 'angle' | 'circle' | 'rectangle' | 'freehand' | 'polygon';
  area?: number; // For closed polygons
  isClosed?: boolean; // For freehand/polygons
  perimeter?: string; // For inline display
  // ... other fields
}
```

---

## How to Test

1. **Open app** → Take photo
2. **Calibrate** with coin (e.g., Quarter - 24.26mm)
3. **Switch to Distance mode** (tap Distance button)
4. **Draw a triangle**:
   - Place point A at (100, 100)
   - Place point B at (300, 100) → Creates line 1
   - Place point A at (300, 100)
   - Place point C at (200, 50) → Creates line 2
   - Place point C at (200, 50)
   - Place point A at (100, 100) → Creates line 3
   
5. **Expected behavior**:
   - ✅ Success haptic plays
   - ✅ Console log: `🔷 Polygon detected! Merging 3 lines`
   - ✅ 3 individual lines disappear
   - ✅ 1 polygon appears (triangle shape)
   - ✅ Legend shows: `"18.5 ft (A: 25.3 ft²)"` (values depend on size)

## Common Mistakes That Break This

### ❌ MISTAKE 1: Removing `'polygon'` from type definitions
**Symptom**: TypeScript errors about `'polygon'` not being assignable to `MeasurementMode`

**Fix**: Add `'polygon'` to all mode type definitions

---

### ❌ MISTAKE 2: Removing function call after placing distance line
**Symptom**: Distance lines work, but never merge into polygons

**Fix**: Ensure `detectAndMergePolygon()` is called in `placePoint()` after creating distance measurement:
```typescript
setMeasurements([...measurements, newMeasurement]);
if (mode === 'distance') {
  detectAndMergePolygon([...measurements, newMeasurement]);
}
```

---

### ❌ MISTAKE 3: Deleting the 175-line function
**Symptom**: "detectAndMergePolygon is not defined" error

**Fix**: Restore function from commit `3775fa5` or from backup file: `/workspace/detectAndMergePolygon_function.txt`

---

### ❌ MISTAKE 4: Removing polygon colors from `MEASUREMENT_COLORS`
**Symptom**: TypeScript error about missing property in Record type

**Fix**: Add polygon colors (around line 70):
```typescript
polygon: [
  { main: '#F97316', glow: '#F97316', name: 'Orange' },
  { main: '#EAB308', glow: '#EAB308', name: 'Yellow' },
  { main: '#84CC16', glow: '#84CC16', name: 'Lime' },
  { main: '#14B8A6', glow: '#14B8A6', name: 'Teal' },
  { main: '#A855F7', glow: '#A855F7', name: 'Purple' },
],
```

**Working commit**: `3775fa5`
**Backup file**: `/workspace/detectAndMergePolygon_function.txt`

To restore from git:
```bash
cd /home/user/workspace
git checkout 3775fa5 -- src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx

## Integration with Other Features

### Works With:
- ✅ Coin calibration mode
- ✅ Map scale mode
- ✅ Metric/Imperial unit switching
- ✅ Drag to edit polygon points (after creation)
- ✅ Undo/delete polygons
- ✅ Export to photos/email with area displayed

### Related Features (DO NOT BREAK):
- **Session colors**: Help button, collapse menu match session theme
- **Battling Bots modal**: Pro/Free user system with trial logic
- **Freehand lasso mode**: Similar area calculation for closed loops
- **Pan tutorial**: Shows on first measurement
- **Calibration hint**: Smart prompts when user struggles without calibration

## Console Logs to Watch For

When working correctly, you'll see:
```
🔷 Polygon detected! Merging 3 lines
🔷 Polygon created: { sides: 3, perimeter: '18.5 ft', area: '25.3 ft²' }
```

When broken, you'll see nothing (function not called) or TypeScript errors.

## Last Updated
**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ WORKING (commit 3775fa5)  
**Tested**: Triangle, square, pentagon detection all working  

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE MAKING CHANGES TO DimensionOverlay.tsx

**READ THIS FIRST:**

1. **Search for `detectAndMergePolygon`** - Make sure it still exists
2. **Check the function is called** after placing distance measurements
3. **Verify types** include `'polygon'` in all mode definitions
4. **Test the feature** after any changes to measurement placement logic
5. **Commit frequently** so you can roll back if broken

**If you break this feature, users will complain that "polygons don't auto-detect anymore".**

## How the Gallery Import Flow Works

### Critical: Gallery Button Modal Flow

**File**: `/src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`

1. User taps gallery button
2. Opens image picker
3. Sets `photoUri` state with selected image
4. Triggers `PhotoTypeSelectionModal` (MUST be rendered inside camera mode's JSX, not outside early return)
5. User selects photo type (Table Shot / Wall Shot)
6. Routes to appropriate calibration:
   - Table Shot → Coin calibration
   - Wall Shot → Menu

**Common Bug**: Modal rendered outside camera mode block = never appears. Must be at ~line 2214 inside camera mode return statement.

---

## Session Color System

**Purpose**: Visual continuity - Help button, collapse menu, mode buttons all use same session color

**Implementation**:
- `sessionColor` prop passed from Camera → MeasurementScreen → DimensionOverlay
- Generated once per camera session
- Persists across measurement screen
- Applied to: Help button background, menu collapse icon, some mode button highlights

**DON'T BREAK**: Help button must use `sessionColor` not hardcoded color. Check line ~6150 for:
```typescript
backgroundColor: sessionColor ? `${sessionColor.main}dd` : 'rgba(100, 149, 237, 0.85)'
```
