# Session Complete - v2.5.10: Freehand Recalibration Fix

## Issues Resolved This Session

### 1. **v2.5.9: Recalibration Display Bug (Initial Fix)**
**Problem**: After recalibrating with a new blueprint scale/unit, measurement display values didn't update automatically. Users had to toggle metric/imperial to see the new values.

**Solution**: Reset `prevUnitSystemRef.current = null` after recalibration to force the display update useEffect to run.

**Result**: âœ… Fixed for distance, angle, circle, rectangle, and polygon measurements

---

### 2. **v2.5.10: Freehand Recalibration Missing (Complete Fix)**
**Problem**: User reported that freehand measurements still weren't updating after recalibration.

**Root Cause**: The `recalculateMeasurement` function only handled `mode === 'freehand' && measurement.isClosed` (closed loops), but was missing the case for **regular open freehand paths**.

**Solution**: Expanded the freehand case to handle both open and closed paths:
```typescript
else if (mode === 'freehand') {
  if (measurement.isClosed) {
    // Closed loop - calculate perimeter
  } else {
    // Open path - calculate total length
  }
}
```

**Result**: âœ… All measurement tools now recalibrate correctly

## All Measurement Tools Now Support Recalibration

| Tool | Recalibration Support |
|------|----------------------|
| âœ… Distance | Working |
| âœ… Angle | Working |
| âœ… Circle | Working |
| âœ… Rectangle | Working |
| âœ… Freehand (open) | **Fixed in v2.5.10** |
| âœ… Freehand (closed) | Working |
| âœ… Polygon | Working |

---

## Testing Steps

1. âœ… Take a photo
2. âœ… Calibrate with blueprint (e.g., 10cm scale)
3. âœ… Create measurements with ALL tools:
   - Distance line
   - Angle
   - Circle
   - Rectangle
   - **Freehand open path** (draw a line)
   - Freehand closed loop (draw and close)
   - Polygon
4. âœ… Recalibrate with different scale (e.g., 5in scale)
5. âœ… **Verify ALL measurements update immediately**
6. âœ… No need to toggle metric/imperial
