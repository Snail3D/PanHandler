# Export System Simplification - Session Summary

## Date
October 14, 2025

## Problem
The previous monthly tracking system was complex and caused bugs:
- Tracked separate monthly counters for saves and emails
- Required date comparison logic to reset monthly
- Confusing UX with separate limits for saves (10) and emails (10)

## Solution: Simplified Lifetime Export System

### New System Design
**Session-Based Tracking**:
- Track which image URIs have been exported (saved OR emailed)
- First export of a session counts as 1 action
- Additional exports of the same session = FREE
- **20 total lifetime exports** for free users
- **Unlimited exports** for Pro users ($9.97 one-time)

### User Experience
**When limit reached**:
- Gray out Save/Email buttons
- Show simple alert: "Join Pro (in Help menu) to unlock"
- Show counter at bottom: "X exports remaining"

**Visual Changes**:
- Export counter appears at bottom of control menu (free users only)
- Save/Email buttons gray out when limit reached
- Counter shows remaining exports: "20 exports remaining" → "1 export remaining"

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/state/measurementStore.ts`
**Changed**:
- Removed: `monthlySaveCount`, `monthlyEmailCount`, `lastResetMonth`
- Added: `exportedSessions: string[]` - array of exported image URIs

**New Methods**:
```typescript
markSessionExported(imageUri: string)  // Mark image as exported
hasSessionBeenExported(imageUri: string)  // Check if already exported
canExport()  // Returns true if user can export (Pro or <20 exports)
getRemainingExports()  // Returns remaining exports (Infinity for Pro)
resetExportLimits()  // For testing - resets export counter
```

### 2. `/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`
**Removed**:
- `showPaywallModal` state (no longer needed)
- PaywallModal import
- PaywallModal rendering at bottom of component
- Old monthly tracker from Pro modal comparison table

**Added**:
- Export counter display above Pro footer (free users only)
- Grayed-out Save/Email buttons when `canExport()` returns false
- `disabled` prop on Save/Email buttons

**Updated**:
- Pro Modal comparison table: "Total exports (save/email): 20 → ∞"
- Save/Email button styling: conditional gray color based on `canExport()`
- Export counter: Shows remaining exports for free users

### 3. Export Functions
**No changes needed** to `handleExport()` and `handleEmail()`:
- Already check `canExport()` before proceeding
- Already call `markSessionExported(currentImageUri)` after successful export
- Alert shown when limit reached

## Testing Instructions

### Test Export Limit
1. Take 20 photos and export each one
2. On 21st photo, Save/Email buttons should be grayed out
3. Counter should show "0 exports remaining"
4. Tapping Save or Email shows alert to join Pro

### Test 5-Tap Pro Toggle (Testing Feature)
1. Tap "Tap for Pro Features" footer 5 times quickly
2. Should toggle between Pro and Free mode
3. When Pro: counter disappears, buttons always active
4. When Free: counter shows, buttons gray out at limit

### Test Export Tracking
1. Export a photo (save)
2. Counter decrements by 1
3. Export same photo again (email) → counter stays same (free)
4. Take new photo and export → counter decrements by 1

## Benefits of New System

1. **Simplicity**: One counter, one limit, easy to understand
2. **No date logic**: No monthly resets, no date comparisons
3. **Fair UX**: Same photo can be saved AND emailed (counts as 1 export)
4. **Clear messaging**: Simple "X exports remaining" counter
5. **Fewer bugs**: Less complex state management

## Notes

- PaywallModal component still exists but is unused (can be deleted later)
- Export counter only visible for free users
- Pro users have unlimited exports (no counter shown)
- 5-tap toggle is for testing only (should be removed in production)
