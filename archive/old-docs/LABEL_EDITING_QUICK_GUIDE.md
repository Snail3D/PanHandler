# Label Editing - Quick Guide

## What Changed? 🎉

### Before ❌
- Had to double-tap measurements rapidly (tricky timing)
- Generic "Label This Item" for everything
- Same boring examples for all shapes

### After ✅
- **Just tap the label badge once!** Much easier!
- Personalized titles: "Label This Circle", "Label This Rectangle", etc.
- Funny shape-specific examples that match what you're measuring

---

## How to Use 🏷️

### Adding/Editing Labels:

1. **Switch to Pan/Zoom mode** (not Measure mode)
2. **Tap any measurement label** - the colored badge with the number
3. Label modal opens instantly
4. Type your custom name or pick from funny suggestions
5. Done!

### What's Tappable:
- ✅ Main measurement labels (the colored number badges)
- ✅ Rectangle side labels (L: and H: badges)
- ✅ Number badges above measurements
- ✅ Any label text

### When Labels Are Tappable:
- ✅ In **Pan/Zoom mode** (when you can move/edit measurements)
- ❌ NOT in **Measure mode** (when placing new measurements)
