## Reasoning

The removed quotes were specifically about:
- The heliocentric model (Copernicus)
- Planetary motion and celestial mechanics (Newton x2)
- Celestial observations (Kant, Galileo)
- Ancient astronomical philosophy (Pythagoras - music of the spheres)

These quotes could be seen as endorsing specific astronomical models or making the app appear to have a scientific/academic agenda. By removing them, the quote list focuses on **making, innovation, creativity, and personal growth** without venturing into scientific cosmology.
