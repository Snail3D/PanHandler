# v2.0.4 Quick Reference

## What Changed

### 🔄 Fixed "Look Down" Fade Transition
**Problem**: Message wasn't switching between "Look Down" and instructions  
**Fix**: Fixed comparison logic bug in orientation detection  
**Result**: Smooth 500ms fade between messages when tilting phone

### 🚫 Auto-Capture Only in Horizontal Mode
**New Behavior**: 
- **Horizontal mode** (looking down): Hold shutter for auto-capture
- **Vertical mode** (upright): Auto-capture disabled, quick tap only

### 🎯 Visual Behavior by Orientation

| Element | Horizontal (Looking Down) | Vertical (Upright) |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Center crosshairs | ✅ Always visible | ✅ Always visible |
| Red level lines | ✅ Visible | ❌ Fades out |
| Auto-capture | ✅ Enabled | ❌ Disabled |
| Quick tap | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Message | "Instructions" | "Look Down" |

## Testing

1. **Tilt phone up** → See "Look Down" message
2. **Tilt phone down** → Message changes to instructions
3. **Watch red lines** → Fade in/out gracefully
4. **Hold shutter upright** → Auto-capture disabled
5. **Hold shutter looking down** → Auto-capture works
6. **Quick tap anytime** → Always captures

## Version
Previous: 2.0.3 → Current: **2.0.4**

## Key Fix
Changed orientation comparison from:
```javascript
if (wasHorizontal !== isHorizontal.value) // ❌ Always false
```
To:
```javascript
if (wasHorizontal !== nowHorizontal) // ✅ Works correctly
```
