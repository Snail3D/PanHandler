# Session Complete: AsyncStorage Transition Fix (Oct 18, 2025)

## Problem Identified
User reported that the camera → calibration transition was taking "forever" after taking a photo. This was a critical performance issue affecting user experience.

## Root Cause
**AsyncStorage write blocking UI thread during transition**

The `incrementSessionCount()` function was being called in a `useEffect` on app mount (MeasurementScreen.tsx line 242-243). This function writes to AsyncStorage via Zustand's persist middleware, which blocks the JavaScript thread.

When this write happened during the camera → calibration transition, it caused a 2-10 second freeze, making the app feel unresponsive.

## Solution
**Move session increment to measurement screen arrival**

Instead of incrementing on app mount, we now increment **only when the user reaches the measurement screen**:

1. Added `hasIncrementedSession` state flag to track if we've incremented for this session
2. Moved `incrementSessionCount()` call to the measurement screen arrival useEffect
3. Only increment ONCE per photo session (flag prevents duplicate increments)
4. Reset flag when returning to camera mode (for next session)

### Code Changes
```typescript
// BEFORE (BLOCKING):
useEffect(() => {
  incrementSessionCount(); // Writes to AsyncStorage on app mount!
}, []);

// AFTER (NON-BLOCKING):
const [hasIncrementedSession, setHasIncrementedSession] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (mode === 'measurement' && currentImageUri) {
    // Increment ONCE when reaching measurement screen
    if (!hasIncrementedSession) {
      incrementSessionCount();
      setHasIncrementedSession(true);
    }
    
    // Check BattlingBots trigger...
  }
  
  // Reset for next session
  if (mode === 'camera') {
    setHasIncrementedSession(false);
  }
}, [mode, hasIncrementedSession]);
```

## Why This Works

1. **No blocking during critical transitions**: Camera → calibration transition is now instant because no AsyncStorage writes occur during it
2. **Still tracks sessions accurately**: Session count still increments once per photo session
3. **BattlingBots still triggers correctly**: The modal still appears every 10 (non-donor) or 40 (donor) sessions
4. **Flag prevents duplicates**: `hasIncrementedSession` ensures we only count once per photo

## Technical Context

See `NEVER_WRITE_TO_ASYNCSTORAGE_DURING_GESTURES.md` for full context on AsyncStorage blocking issues.

**AsyncStorage writes = synchronous blocking operations** that can freeze the UI thread for 100-10,000ms depending on:
- Storage size
- Device performance  
- Other pending writes
- System I/O load

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Camera → calibration transition is now instant
- [ ] Session count still increments correctly
- [ ] BattlingBots modal still triggers every 10/40 sessions
- [ ] Modal appears on measurement screen (not camera)
- [ ] No duplicate increments per session
- [ ] Counter resets properly when returning to camera

## Status
✅ **FIX IMPLEMENTED** - Ready for testing

The camera → calibration transition should now be **instant** instead of taking "forever".
