# v2.0.9 - Graceful Orientation Transitions

## Version
**2.0.8 ‚Üí 2.0.9**

## Enhancement

### üåä Smooth Fade Transitions for Level Lines
**User Request**: "Can we have the leveling lines and the center circle in the camera screen come on and off more gracefully with the switch between the horizontal and vertical orientations?"

#### Problem:
- Red level lines appeared/disappeared instantly when tilting phone
- Jarring visual experience when switching between horizontal and vertical
- Opacity changed from 1 ‚Üí 0 or 0 ‚Üí 1 with no animation

#### Solution:
Added smooth 400ms fade transitions using dedicated animated shared value

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Created Dedicated Shared Value (Line 170):
```javascript
const levelLinesOpacity = useSharedValue(1); // Smooth fade for red level lines
```

### 2. Animate on Orientation Change (Lines 637-645):
```javascript
// Smooth fade for level lines when orientation changes
const targetOpacity = nowHorizontal ? 1 : 0;
if (Math.abs(levelLinesOpacity.value - targetOpacity) > 0.01) {
  levelLinesOpacity.value = withTiming(targetOpacity, { 
    duration: 400, // Smooth 400ms fade
    easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.ease),
  });
}
```

### 3. Updated Red Level Lines to Use Animated Opacity:

**Horizontal Red Line** (Lines 1393-1399):
```javascript
// Before
opacity: horizontal ? 1 : 0, // Instant change

// After
opacity: levelLinesOpacity.value, // Smooth animated fade
```

**Vertical Red Line** (Lines 1422-1428):
```javascript
// Before
opacity: horizontal ? 1 : 0, // Instant change

// After
opacity: levelLinesOpacity.value, // Smooth animated fade
```

## Visual Behavior

### Tilting Phone Up (Horizontal ‚Üí Vertical):
- ‚úÖ Red level lines fade out smoothly over 400ms
- ‚úÖ "Aim down for auto level/capture" message fades in
- ‚úÖ Center gray crosshairs stay visible
- ‚úÖ Smooth, graceful transition

### Tilting Phone Down (Vertical ‚Üí Horizontal):
- ‚úÖ Red level lines fade in smoothly over 400ms
- ‚úÖ Instructions message fades in
- ‚úÖ Center gray crosshairs stay visible
- ‚úÖ Smooth, graceful transition

## Timing Details

| Element | Fade Duration | Easing |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Red level lines** | 400ms | Ease in-out |
| **Messages** | 500ms | Linear (already set) |
| **Center crosshairs** | Always visible | N/A |

---

## What Changed

### src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx:
1. **Line 170**: Added `levelLinesOpacity` shared value
2. **Lines 637-645**: Animation logic when orientation changes
3. **Lines 1393-1399**: Horizontal red line uses animated opacity
4. **Lines 1422-1428**: Vertical red line uses animated opacity

## Benefits

### Before:
- ‚ùå Level lines appeared/disappeared instantly
- ‚ùå Jarring visual experience
- ‚ùå Felt abrupt and unpolished

### After:
- ‚úÖ Smooth 400ms fade in/out
- ‚úÖ Graceful, polished transitions
- ‚úÖ Matches iOS design principles
- ‚úÖ Professional feel

---

## Testing

### Orientation Changes:
- [ ] Tilt phone slowly from horizontal to vertical
- [ ] Watch red lines fade out gracefully over ~400ms
- [ ] Tilt phone back to horizontal
- [ ] Watch red lines fade in gracefully over ~400ms
- [ ] Try rapid tilting - should handle smoothly
- [ ] Center crosshairs should stay visible throughout

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Rapid back-and-forth tilting
- [ ] Holding phone at ~45¬∞ (between modes)
- [ ] Quick snaps between orientations

---

## Notes

- 400ms duration chosen to match iOS standard animation timing
- Ease-in-out curve provides natural feeling motion
- Center crosshairs intentionally always visible (not animated)
- Messages already had 500ms fade (kept as-is for continuity)

---

## Files Modified
- `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx` - Added smooth fade transitions
- `app.json` - Version 2.0.9

---

## Impact

The app now feels more polished and professional with smooth, graceful transitions between horizontal and vertical orientations. No more jarring on/off snapping!
