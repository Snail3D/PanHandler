# Settings Modals Fix - Version 4.0.9

## Issue
User reported that the Email Address and Magnetic Declination settings in the Help Modal were not functional - the arrows were present but clicking them did nothing useful.

## Root Cause
Both settings had Pressable handlers, but they only showed placeholder alerts:
- **Email Address**: Showed "This feature is coming soon!" alert
- **Magnetic Declination**: Showed an info alert with instructions but no way to edit

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created MagneticDeclinationModal Component
**File**: `/src/components/MagneticDeclinationModal.tsx`

A new modal component that allows users to:
- Enter magnetic declination in degrees
- See examples (positive for East, negative for West)
- Click a link to NOAA's magnetic declination calculator
- Save or cancel changes
- Uses glassmorphic design consistent with EmailPromptModal

### 2. Updated HelpModal Component
**File**: `/src/components/HelpModal.tsx`

Changes made:
- **Imported both modals**: `EmailPromptModal` and `MagneticDeclinationModal`
- **Added state management**: 
  - `const [showEmailModal, setShowEmailModal] = useState(false)`
  - `const [showDeclinationModal, setShowDeclinationModal] = useState(false)`
- **Added setUserEmail from store**: `const setUserEmail = useStore((s) => s.setUserEmail)`
- **Updated Email button handler**: Opens `EmailPromptModal` instead of showing alert
- **Updated Declination button handler**: Opens `MagneticDeclinationModal` instead of showing alert
- **Rendered both modals**: Added modal components at the end with proper handlers

### 3. Features Now Working

#### Email Address Setting:
✅ Click "Not set" or email address  
✅ Opens beautiful glassmorphic modal  
✅ Enter email address  
✅ Auto-populates for bug reports  
✅ Stored locally on device  

#### Magnetic Declination Setting:
✅ Click declination value (e.g., "0° East")  
✅ Opens dedicated modal  
✅ Enter declination in degrees  
✅ Link to NOAA calculator website  
✅ Updates immediately for map mode measurements  

## User Flow

### Email Address:
1. User taps "Not set" in Settings
2. EmailPromptModal appears with glassmorphic design
3. User enters email (e.g., "user@example.com")
4. Taps "Save" or presses Return
5. Email is stored and displayed in settings
6. Future bug reports auto-populate with this email

### Magnetic Declination:
1. User taps declination value (e.g., "0° East")
2. MagneticDeclinationModal appears
3. User can:
   - Enter custom value (e.g., "14.5" for 14.5° East)
   - Click link to find their location's declination
   - Save or cancel
4. Value updates and affects azimuth measurements in Map Mode

## Technical Details

### State Management:
- Email stored in: `userEmail` (Zustand store with AsyncStorage)
- Declination stored in: `magneticDeclination` (Zustand store with AsyncStorage)
- Both persist between sessions

### Design Consistency:
- Both modals use glassmorphic BlurView design
- Consistent button styles (glassmorphic Save, minimal Cancel)
- Proper haptic feedback on all interactions
- Auto-dismiss keyboard on submit

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Email modal opens when clicking email setting
- [x] Email can be entered and saved
- [x] Email persists after closing and reopening app
- [x] Declination modal opens when clicking declination setting
- [x] Declination can be entered and saved
- [x] Declination persists and affects measurements
- [x] NOAA link opens correctly
- [x] Both modals can be dismissed via Cancel or X button
- [x] Keyboard dismisses properly
- [x] Haptics work on all interactions

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/HelpModal.tsx` - Added modal imports, state, and handlers
2. `/src/components/MagneticDeclinationModal.tsx` - New file created
3. `/app.json` - Version bump 4.0.8 → 4.0.9

## Files Referenced (Existing)
- `/src/components/EmailPromptModal.tsx` - Already existed, now properly integrated
- `/src/state/measurementStore.ts` - Store contains userEmail and magneticDeclination

## Result
✅ Both settings are now fully functional  
✅ Beautiful, consistent UI/UX  
✅ Proper state persistence  
✅ Ready for production use
