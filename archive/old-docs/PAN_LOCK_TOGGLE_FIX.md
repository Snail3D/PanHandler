# Pan Lock Toggle Fix - v1.73

## Problem
- Unable to pan in calibration screen
- Unable to pan in measurement screen
- Pan button in control menu wasn't acting as a lock toggle

## Solution

### 1. Added Manual Pan Lock Toggle
**DimensionOverlay.tsx:**
- Added `isPanLocked` state (starts as `true`)
- Modified Pan button to toggle this state with haptic feedback
- Changed button from "Edit"/"Pan" to "Locked"/"Unlocked" with lock icons
- Added `onPanLockChange` callback prop to notify parent

**MeasurementScreen.tsx:**
- Added `manualPanLock` state
- Updated logic: `isPanZoomLocked = hasAnyMeasurements ? manualPanLock : false`
- Added callback handler to sync lock state from DimensionOverlay

### 2. Fixed ZoomableImageV2 Pan Logic
**ZoomableImageV2.tsx:**
- Fixed: `.enabled(!locked || singleFingerPan)` 
- Now correctly allows panning when:
  - NOT locked (unlocked in measurement screen), OR
  - singleFingerPan is true (calibration screen)

### 3. Auto-Relock on New Measurements
- When all measurements are cleared and a new one is added, auto-lock is re-enabled
- Prevents accidental navigation while measuring

## How It Works Now

### Calibration Screen
âœ… 1-finger pan works (singleFingerPan=true)
âœ… 2-finger pinch/zoom works
âœ… Rotation works

### Measurement Screen (no measurements)
âœ… 2-finger pan/zoom/rotate works freely
- Lock button is inactive

### Measurement Screen (with measurements)
ðŸ”’ **Locked** (default): 
- Pan/zoom disabled
- Button shows lock icon + "Locked"
- Prevents accidental movement while measuring

ðŸ”“ **Tap button to unlock**: 
- Enables 2-finger pan/zoom/rotate
- Button shows unlock icon + "Unlocked"
- Navigate while keeping measurements

ðŸ”’ **Tap again to lock**: 
- Re-locks navigation
- Returns to measuring mode
