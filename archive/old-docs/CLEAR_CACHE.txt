ðŸ”§ HOW TO CLEAR REACT NATIVE CACHE & FIX THE ERROR

The code is already fixed, but your app may be running cached code.
Try these steps in order:

METHOD 1: Quick Reload (Try this first)
- In the app, shake your device or press Cmd+D (iOS simulator)
- Tap "Reload"

METHOD 2: Clear Metro Bundler Cache
Stop the dev server and run:
```
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

METHOD 3: Nuclear Option (if error persists)
```
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then run:
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf ios/build
rm -rf android/build
rm -rf $TMPDIR/react-*
rm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-*
bun install
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

METHOD 4: Close and reopen the Vibecode preview
- The Vibecode system auto-manages the dev server
- Sometimes closing and reopening the preview helps

The actual fix in the code:
- Line 1428-1438 now has extra defensive checks
- Checks if touches exists and is an array
- Safely maps over touches with fallbacks
- This prevents "Object is not a function" error

The error you're seeing is from OLD cached JavaScript that hasn't reloaded yet.
