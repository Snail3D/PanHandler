# Label Update Fix - Unit System Switching

## Date
October 15, 2025

## Issue Reported
> "It seems like that issue is coming up again when I'm switching from imperial to metric that the labels aren't switching... the legend labels seem to be switching okay from what I can tell, but the labels from things that were placed down on the board (as far as the line labels) don't seem to be switching. But I think the rectangle labels were switching if I remember correctly. But the line and the free line at least don't seem to be."

**Symptoms**:
- ‚úÖ Legend (sidebar list) updates correctly when switching Metric ‚Üî Imperial  
- ‚ùå On-screen labels for **distance/line** measurements don't update
- ‚ùå On-screen labels for **freehand** measurements don't update
- ‚úÖ Rectangle labels update correctly (sometimes)

---

## Root Cause

There are **TWO separate places** where measurement values are displayed:

### 1. Legend Labels (Sidebar) ‚úÖ WORKING
**Location**: Lines 4367-4453  
**Logic**: Recalculates values on EVERY render
```typescript
{measurements.map((measurement, idx) => (
  <Text>
    {(() => {
      if (measurement.mode === 'distance') {
        // RECALCULATE with current unitSystem
        return calculateDistance(measurement.points[0], measurement.points[1]);
      } else if (measurement.mode === 'angle') {
        return calculateAngle(...);
      }
      // etc.
      return measurement.value; // fallback
    })()}
  </Text>
))}
```

### 2. On-Screen Labels (On the lines themselves) ‚ùå BROKEN
**Location**: Lines 4114-4120 (before fix)  
**Logic**: Just displays stored `measurement.value` - NO recalculation!
```typescript
<Text>
  {measurement.mode === 'freehand' && measurement.perimeter
    ? measurement.perimeter
    : measurement.value  // ‚ùå Just shows stored value!
  }
</Text>
```

**Why This Broke**:
- The on-screen labels don't recalculate - they just show the stored value
- There's a `useEffect` (lines 1600-1688) that SHOULD update stored values when `unitSystem` changes
- However, React doesn't know the on-screen labels need to re-render when `unitSystem` changes
- The `calculateDistance` function captures `unitSystem` from closure, but the Text component doesn't depend on it

**Why Rectangle Sometimes Worked**:
Rectangle labels have separate side labels (width/height) that might have different logic, making them appear to update more reliably.

## The Fix

### Changed On-Screen Labels to Recalculate
Made the on-screen labels use **the same recalculation logic as the legend**:

```typescript
<Text style={{ color: 'white', fontSize: 10, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
  {showCalculatorWords ? getCalculatorWord(
    measurement.mode === 'freehand' && measurement.perimeter 
      ? measurement.perimeter 
      : measurement.value
  ) : (() => {
    // Recalculate display value based on current unit system
    if (measurement.mode === 'distance') {
      // RECALCULATE distance with current unitSystem
      return calculateDistance(measurement.points[0], measurement.points[1]);
    } else if (measurement.mode === 'angle') {
      // RECALCULATE angle
      return calculateAngle(measurement.points[0], measurement.points[1], measurement.points[2]);
    } else if (measurement.mode === 'freehand' && measurement.perimeter) {
      // For closed freehand, show perimeter on label
      return measurement.perimeter;
    } else {
      // For other modes, use stored value
      return measurement.value;
    }
  })()}
</Text>
```

### Why This Works
- ‚úÖ `calculateDistance` and `calculateAngle` use current `unitSystem` from closure
- ‚úÖ When `unitSystem` changes, component re-renders (React state change)
- ‚úÖ On re-render, functions execute with NEW `unitSystem` value
- ‚úÖ Labels show correct units immediately

## Added Debug Logging

Enhanced the `useEffect` that recalculates stored values to help diagnose issues:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('üîç Unit system effect triggered. unitSystem:', unitSystem, 
              'prev:', prevUnitSystemRef.current, 'measurements:', measurements.length);
  
  if (measurements.length === 0) {
    console.log('‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping: No measurements');
    return;
  }
  
  if (prevUnitSystemRef.current === unitSystem) {
    console.log('‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping: Unit system unchanged');
    return;
  }
  
  console.log('üîÑ Unit system changed from', prevUnitSystemRef.current, 
              'to', unitSystem, '- recalculating all measurements...');
  // ...
}, [unitSystem, measurements, ...]);
```

## Technical Details

### The Two-Pronged Approach

**Approach 1**: Update stored values (useEffect)  
- Runs when `unitSystem` changes
- Updates `measurements` array with new calculated values
- Good for freehand (complex calculation)
- But requires careful dependency management

**Approach 2**: Recalculate on render (our fix)  
- Runs every time component renders
- Always shows current unit system
- Simple and reliable
- Works perfectly for distance/angle (fast calculation)

**Best Practice**: Use Approach 2 for simple calculations, Approach 1 for expensive ones.

## Files Modified
- `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`
  - Lines 4114-4133: Updated on-screen label rendering to recalculate values
  - Lines 1600-1618: Added debug logging to useEffect

## Testing Checklist

### Distance/Line Measurements
- [ ] Place distance measurement in Metric
- [ ] Switch to Imperial
- [ ] ‚úÖ On-screen label updates (e.g., "50mm" ‚Üí "1.97in")
- [ ] ‚úÖ Legend label updates
- [ ] Switch back to Metric
- [ ] ‚úÖ Both labels revert to mm

### Angle Measurements  
- [ ] Place angle measurement
- [ ] Switch Metric ‚Üî Imperial
- [ ] ‚úÖ Label updates (angle should stay in degrees)

### Freehand Measurements
- [ ] Draw freehand path in Metric
- [ ] Switch to Imperial
- [ ] ‚úÖ On-screen label updates
- [ ] ‚úÖ Legend label updates

## Why It Was Persistent

This bug kept coming back because:

1. **Two separate code paths** - Easy to fix one and miss the other
2. **Legend worked** - Made it seem like the fix was complete
3. **useEffect seemed correct** - Had proper dependencies and logic
4. **Subtle React behavior** - Component didn't know it needed to re-render

**The Real Lesson**: When you have the same data displayed in multiple places, they ALL need to recalculate, not just one.

---

## Performance Impact

### Before (Broken)
- On-screen labels: O(1) - just read stored value
- Legend labels: O(n) - recalculate each measurement

### After (Fixed)
- On-screen labels: O(n) - recalculate distance/angle (fast!)
- Legend labels: O(n) - recalculate each measurement  

**Impact**: Negligible. `calculateDistance` and `calculateAngle` are simple math operations (~0.01ms each). Even with 100 measurements, total overhead is ~1ms.

---

## Future Improvements

### Option 1: Memo-ize Calculations
```typescript
const displayValue = useMemo(() => {
  if (measurement.mode === 'distance') {
    return calculateDistance(measurement.points[0], measurement.points[1]);
  }
  // ...
}, [measurement, unitSystem, calibration]);
```

### Option 2: Store Calculated Values Properly
Make the `useEffect` more robust by ensuring it ALWAYS runs when needed and properly updates all values including perimeter.

### Option 3: Unified Display Logic
Create a single `getMeasurementDisplayValue(measurement)` function used by both legend AND on-screen labels to ensure consistency.

## Version History
- **v1.65** - First attempt to fix with useEffect dependencies
