# v2.2.18 Quick Reference

## What's New
Two features implemented as requested:

### 1. 🎯 Undo Single Point
**Tap undo to remove just the last point** instead of deleting the entire measurement.

**Example:**
- Place first corner of rectangle ✓
- Place second corner ✗ (wrong spot)
- Tap undo → Second corner removed, first corner stays
- Place second corner again ✓

**Priority:**
1. If placing points → removes last point
2. If completed measurements → reverts/deletes measurement

---

### 2. 📏 Feet/Inches Formatting
**Imperial feet now display as traditional feet'inches" format.**

**Examples:**
- `45.05 ft` → `45'1"`
- `45.50 ft` → `45'6"`
- `45.00 ft` → `45'`
- `100.99 ft` → `101'`

**Where it appears:**
- Coin calibration mode (imperial)
- Map scale mode (when set to feet)
- All measurement types (distance, rectangle, circle, freehand, polygon)

---

## Testing
✅ Undo removes individual points
✅ Feet display as traditional format
✅ No breaking changes
✅ TypeScript compiles without errors

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` - Undo logic + map scale feet formatting
2. `/src/utils/unitConversion.ts` - Coin calibration feet formatting
