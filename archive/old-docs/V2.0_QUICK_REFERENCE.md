## Testing the Special Offer

### Method 1: Manual Session Count
```javascript
// In your code, temporarily set:
useStore.setState({ sessionCount: 49 });
// Then restart app → Session 50 offer appears
```

### Method 2: Dev Button (Recommended)
Add to Help Modal for easy testing:
```tsx
{__DEV__ && (
  <Pressable onPress={() => {
    useStore.setState({ 
      sessionCount: 49,
      specialOfferTriggered: false,
      specialOfferSessionsLeft: 3 
    });
  }}>
    <Text>Reset to Session 50</Text>
  </Pressable>
)}
```

**Session 51** - $5.97:
> 💪 You're Twisting Our Arm
> 
> Alright tough guy, we'll drop it even MORE. But seriously, this squiggly line is pretty cool...

**Session 52** - $4.97:
> 🚨 LAST CHANCE ALERT
> 
> This is it. Final price. We're basically giving it away. After this? Full price forever.
