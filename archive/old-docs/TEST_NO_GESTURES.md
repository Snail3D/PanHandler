# Test: Remove All Gestures

##Status
Having trouble isolating the freeze issue. Multiple attempts to conditionally disable GestureDetector have failed.

## Current Theory
The 10-15 second freeze when placing measurement points is caused by one of:
1. **GestureDetector** processing every touch (even single taps)
2. **Touch responder** in DimensionOverlay doing heavy processing
3. **React state updates** causing render storms

## Next Steps To Try
1. Add console.log timestamps in DimensionOverlay onResponderGrant to measure actual delay
2. Profile the app to see what's blocking the main thread
3. Check if there are any pending promises or async operations blocking

## Quick Question
When you say "freezes for 10-15 seconds" - does the entire app freeze (buttons don't work, nothing responds), or just the measurement placement is delayed?
