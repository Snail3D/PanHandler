# v2.1.6 - Smooth Rectangle Point Movement

## Version
**2.1.5 → 2.1.6**

## Enhancement

### 🎯 Fluid Rectangle Corner Movement

**Issue Reported:**
"When I grab a point on the rectangle and move it to adjust, it seems blocky and chunky. I still want it to be able to snap to another point, but it should be getting really close to the other point... Moving the box with the other points should be really fluid."

**Root Cause:**
When moving rectangle corners (or any point), the snap distance was **7mm** (~70 pixels), which created a huge "magnetic" zone that made movement feel chunky and blocky. The point would snap to other points way too early, preventing smooth, fluid adjustment.

**Solution:**
Reduced snap distance from **7mm → 0.5mm** when moving points
- 14x tighter snap threshold
- Only snaps when VERY close to another point (within ~5 pixels)
- Movement is now smooth and fluid
- Still snaps for alignment, but only at the last moment

## Technical Details

### Before (v2.1.5):
```javascript
// snapToNearbyPoint function
const SNAP_DISTANCE_MM = moveMode ? 7 : 1;  // 7mm when moving points
const SNAP_DISTANCE = calibration 
  ? SNAP_DISTANCE_MM * calibration.pixelsPerUnit 
  : (moveMode ? 60 : 30);  // 60px fallback when moving
```

**With typical calibration** (10 px/mm):
- Snap distance: **7mm × 10 = 70 pixels**
- Huge snap radius around every point
- Snaps way before you want it to

### After (v2.1.6):
```javascript
// snapToNearbyPoint function
const SNAP_DISTANCE_MM = moveMode ? 0.5 : 1;  // 0.5mm when moving points (14x tighter!)
const SNAP_DISTANCE = calibration 
  ? SNAP_DISTANCE_MM * calibration.pixelsPerUnit 
  : (moveMode ? 5 : 30);  // 5px fallback when moving (12x tighter!)
```

**With typical calibration** (10 px/mm):
- Snap distance: **0.5mm × 10 = 5 pixels**
- Tiny snap radius (pinpoint accuracy)
- Only snaps when virtually touching another point

## Visual Comparison

### Snap Radius Visualization:

**OLD (v2.1.5)**: 70px snap radius
```
      Other Point
          ●
    [----------]  ← 70px radius
    [----------]     Snaps anywhere
    [----●-----]     in this huge zone
    [----------]     (feels magnetic)
    [----------]
    
    Your Corner
```

**NEW (v2.1.6)**: 5px snap radius
```
      Other Point
          ●
         [●]  ← 5px radius
              Only snaps when
    ●         virtually touching
              (feels fluid)

## Impact by Calibration

### High Precision Calibration (20 px/mm):
| Version | Snap Distance | Snap Radius | Feel |
|---------|--------------|-------------|------|
| v2.1.5 | 7mm | **140 pixels** | Extremely chunky |
| v2.1.6 | 0.5mm | **10 pixels** | Smooth |

### Medium Calibration (10 px/mm):
| Version | Snap Distance | Snap Radius | Feel |
|---------|--------------|-------------|------|
| v2.1.5 | 7mm | **70 pixels** | Very chunky |
| v2.1.6 | 0.5mm | **5 pixels** | Fluid |

### Low Calibration (5 px/mm):
| Version | Snap Distance | Snap Radius | Feel |
|---------|--------------|-------------|------|
| v2.1.5 | 7mm | **35 pixels** | Chunky |
| v2.1.6 | 0.5mm | **2.5 pixels** | Very smooth |

**Key Insight**: The improvement is consistent across all calibrations - always 14x tighter!

## User Experience

### Before (v2.1.5):
- ❌ **Chunky, blocky movement**
- ❌ Snaps way too early (70px away)
- ❌ Can't get close to points without snapping
- ❌ Feels "magnetic" and frustrating
- ❌ Hard to make precise adjustments
- ❌ Fighting the snap system

### After (v2.1.6):
- ✅ **Smooth, fluid movement**
- ✅ Only snaps when virtually touching (~5px)
- ✅ Can move freely near points
- ✅ Natural, predictable behavior
- ✅ Easy to make precise adjustments
- ✅ Snap still helps alignment when needed

## What Still Snaps?

The snap feature is still active and helpful, just much more refined:

### Snap Behavior:
1. **Movement**: Smooth and fluid (no snap until very close)
2. **Approach**: When within 5 pixels of another point...
3. **Snap**: Point magnetically locks to target (double haptic feedback)
4. **Alignment**: Perfect alignment achieved!

### Haptic Feedback:
- **Entering snap**: Double-tap haptic (tap...pause...tap)
- **Leaving snap**: Single-tap haptic
- Unchanged from v2.1.4, still works great!

## Affected Shapes

### Rectangle Corner Dragging:
- Grab any corner → move smoothly → only snaps when touching another point
- Maintains axis-aligned rectangle while moving

### Circle Edge Point:
- Already had smooth movement (circle edge points don't snap)
- No change needed

### Polygon/Freehand Points:
- Also benefit from reduced snap threshold
- Smooth reshaping with snap-to-align when needed

### Distance/Angle Points:
- Also use same snap logic
- Fluid adjustment with precise snapping

## Code Location

**File**: `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`

**Lines 1091-1098**: Snap threshold definition
```javascript
const snapToNearbyPoint = (cursorX: number, cursorY: number, moveMode: boolean = false) => {
  // Use very small threshold (0.5mm) when moving points for smooth, fluid movement
  // Only snap when VERY close to another point
  const SNAP_DISTANCE_MM = moveMode ? 0.5 : 1;
  const SNAP_DISTANCE = calibration 
    ? SNAP_DISTANCE_MM * calibration.pixelsPerUnit 
    : (moveMode ? 5 : 30); // fallback pixels if not calibrated (5px when moving)
```

**Lines 3855-3861**: Where snap is checked during point dragging
```javascript
if (shouldCheckSnapping) {
  const snappedPosition = snapToNearbyPoint(pageX, pageY, true);  // moveMode = true
  if (snappedPosition.snapped) {
    finalPosition = snappedPosition;
    isCurrentlySnapped = true;
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Rectangle Corner Movement:
- [ ] Grab rectangle corner
- [ ] Move corner freely (should feel smooth, not blocky)
- [ ] Approach another point (no snap until very close)
- [ ] Get within ~5 pixels → feel double-tap haptic (snap engaged)
- [ ] Pull away → feel single haptic (snap released)
- [ ] Movement feels fluid and natural

### Other Shapes:
- [ ] Move distance measurement points (smooth movement)
- [ ] Move angle measurement points (smooth movement)
- [ ] Reshape polygon points (smooth movement)
- [ ] All shapes feel consistent

## Design Rationale

### Why 0.5mm?
- **Previous 7mm**: Size of half a fingertip (way too large for precision work)
- **New 0.5mm**: Width of a fine mechanical pencil line (perfect for digital precision)
- **Result**: Only snaps when you genuinely want alignment, not accidentally

### Why Not Smaller?
- 0.5mm (~5px) is about the limit of touchscreen precision
- Smaller would make snapping impossible (finger isn't that precise)
- 0.5mm strikes perfect balance: smooth movement + helpful snap

### Why Not Larger?
- Even 1mm (~10px) would feel chunky at high zoom
- 7mm was completely unusable (felt broken)
- 0.5mm gives professional CAD-like feel

## Files Modified
- `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` - Snap threshold (lines 1094-1098)
- `app.json` - Version bump to 2.1.6

---

## Why v2.1.6?

Refinement of existing snap behavior - improves usability without changing core functionality. Perfect for patch version.

---

## Summary

**Problem**: Rectangle corner movement felt chunky and blocky due to huge 7mm snap threshold

**Solution**: Reduced snap threshold from 7mm → 0.5mm (14x tighter)

**Result**: 
- Smooth, fluid movement when dragging points
- Snap still works, but only when virtually touching another point
- Natural, predictable behavior that feels professional

**Movement is now smooth and responsive! 🎯**
