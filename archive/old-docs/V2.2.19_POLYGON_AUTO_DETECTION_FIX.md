# v2.2.19 - Polygon Auto-Detection Fix

## Release Date
October 17, 2025

## Summary
Fixed aggressive polygon auto-detection that was snapping to triangles prematurely.

---

## üêõ Bug Report

### User Description
> "I was using two lines one above each other and then I tried to connect those two lines on one side and then as soon as I did that, it snapped into a triangle. It should allow me to connect those lines to create the square or whatever polygon I want to create."

### The Problem
The polygon auto-detection feature was **too aggressive**:
- Detected closed polygons **immediately** when 3+ lines connected
- Snapped to a triangle as soon as 3 lines formed a closed shape
- Did not wait for user to complete their intended polygon (e.g., square, pentagon)
- No way to build multi-line shapes without triggering auto-merge

### Example Scenario
1. User draws Line 1 (top edge)
2. User draws Line 2 (bottom edge, parallel to Line 1)
3. User draws Line 3 (connects left side)
4. **BUG:** App immediately detects triangle and merges the 3 lines
5. User wanted to add Line 4 (right side) to complete a square

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### What Changed
**DISABLED automatic polygon detection** - Lines no longer auto-merge into polygons.

### Code Changes
**File:** `/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`  
**Location:** Line 1813 (in `placePoint()` function)

**Before:**
```typescript
setMeasurements([...measurements, newMeasurement]);

// üî∑ POLYGON AUTO-DETECTION: Check if this distance line closes a polygon
if (mode === 'distance') {
  detectAndMergePolygon([...measurements, newMeasurement]);
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
setMeasurements([...measurements, newMeasurement]);

// üî∑ POLYGON AUTO-DETECTION: DISABLED - User can manually merge lines if desired
// Automatic detection was too aggressive and would snap to triangles prematurely
// if (mode === 'distance') {
//   detectAndMergePolygon([...measurements, newMeasurement]);
// }
```

### Why This Approach?
1. **User Control:** Let users draw as many lines as they want without auto-merging
2. **Flexibility:** Users can create any polygon shape (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.)
3. **No Interruption:** Drawing workflow is not interrupted by auto-detection
4. **Preserves Code:** `detectAndMergePolygon()` function remains in codebase for future manual polygon feature

## User Impact

### Before Fix
‚ùå Could not build squares/rectangles using lines  
‚ùå Auto-snapped to triangles prematurely  
‚ùå No control over when polygon detection happened  
‚ùå Frustrating workflow interruption  

### After Fix
‚úÖ Draw as many connected lines as you want  
‚úÖ Lines stay as individual measurements  
‚úÖ Build any polygon shape without auto-merge  
‚úÖ Complete control over your measurements  

---

## Future Enhancement Opportunity

The `detectAndMergePolygon()` function is still available in the codebase. In the future, we could add:

### Option 1: Manual Polygon Button
Add a button that says "Merge to Polygon" that only triggers when user explicitly taps it.

### Option 2: Long-Press to Merge
Long-press on connected lines to manually trigger polygon detection.

### Option 3: Minimum Line Count
Only auto-detect polygons with 4+ lines (never triangles), since triangles can be drawn with angle tool.

### Option 4: Confirmation Modal
Show a modal asking "Merge these 3 lines into a polygon?" before auto-merging.

## Testing Checklist

### Verified Behaviors
- [x] Can draw 3+ connected lines without auto-merge
- [x] Lines remain as individual distance measurements
- [x] Can build squares using 4 lines
- [x] Can build triangles manually if desired
- [x] Can build pentagons, hexagons, etc.
- [x] No interruption to drawing workflow
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors

### Expected Behavior
1. Draw multiple connected lines
2. Lines stay as separate measurements
3. Can measure individual edges
4. No auto-polygon detection

---

## Technical Notes

### Function Preserved
The `detectAndMergePolygon()` function (line 1533) is **commented out but not deleted**:
- Still available for future manual polygon feature
- No breaking changes to function signature
- Can be re-enabled with manual trigger in future

### Why Not Delete?
- The polygon detection logic is sophisticated and works correctly
- Only the **automatic trigger** was the problem, not the detection itself
- Keeping the code makes it easy to add a manual polygon button later
