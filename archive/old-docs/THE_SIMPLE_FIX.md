# THE SIMPLE FIX - Rotation/Pinch Gestures Always Enabled

## The Problem
Menu buttons became unresponsive after rotating the image. We tried debounce strategies, z-index fixes, pointerEvents changes, and aggressive cleanup - NOTHING worked.

## The Root Cause (SIMPLE!)
**Rotation and pinch gestures were ALWAYS ENABLED, even when the image was locked!**

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const pinchGesture = Gesture.Pinch()
  .enabled(true) // Always allow pinch to zoom ‚ùå

const rotationGesture = Gesture.Rotation()
  .enabled(true) // Always allow rotation ‚ùå
```

Meanwhile, pan gesture correctly respected the locked state:
```typescript
const panGesture = Gesture.Pan()
  .enabled(!locked || singleFingerPan) // ‚úÖ Respects locked state
```

## Why This Broke Everything
1. When measurements exist, `locked` prop is set to `true`
2. Pan gesture disables correctly
3. **But rotation and pinch stay active!**
4. User rotates ‚Üí gesture captures touches
5. Gesture handler holds onto touch events at native level
6. Touch events never reach the menu buttons
7. Buttons appear "stuck" or unresponsive

## The Fix (ONE LINE EACH)
```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED):
const pinchGesture = Gesture.Pinch()
  .enabled(!locked) // Disable when locked (respect locked state) ‚úÖ

const rotationGesture = Gesture.Rotation()
  .enabled(!locked) // Disable when locked (respect locked state) ‚úÖ
```

## Why We Missed It
The comments said "Always allow" which made us think this was intentional behavior. We were looking for complex gesture timing issues when the problem was simply that gestures were running when they shouldn't be!

## Files Modified
- `src/components/ZoomableImageV2.tsx` - Lines 96 and 115

## Testing
1. Take a photo and calibrate
2. Add some measurements (this locks the image)
3. Try to rotate the image ‚Üí **Should NOT rotate** (locked)
4. Tap menu buttons ‚Üí **Should respond immediately** ‚úÖ

The gestures should only work when in Pan mode (before any measurements). Once measurements exist, all gestures (pan, pinch, rotation) should be disabled.

**User's intuition was RIGHT** - it was something simple we were overlooking! üéØ
