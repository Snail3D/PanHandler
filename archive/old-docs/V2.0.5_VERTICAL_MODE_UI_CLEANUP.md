# v2.0.5 - Vertical Mode UI Cleanup

## Version
**2.0.4 ‚Üí 2.0.5**

## Changes

### 1. üéØ Hide Bubble Level Crosshairs in Vertical Mode
**User Request**: "When in vertical mode I want the crosshair or bubble level to disappear. Not the crosshair, but the colored line that moves back and forth."

**What Was Hidden**: The small 120x120px gray crosshairs in the center of the screen (the ones that glow when aligned)

**Implementation** (lines 1443-1461):
```javascript
<Animated.View 
  style={[
    { /* positioning */ },
    crosshairContainerStyle,
    (() => {
      'worklet';
      const horizontal = isHorizontal.value;
      return {
        opacity: horizontal ? 1 : 0, // Hide in vertical mode
      };
    })(),
  ]}
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Bubble level crosshairs visible ONLY in horizontal mode (looking down)
- ‚úÖ Crosshairs gracefully fade out when phone goes vertical
- ‚úÖ Clean view in vertical mode for portrait photos

---

### 2. üìç Moved Message to Same Position
**User Request**: "Can you have that replace or be the same in the same area as the other bubble menu? Just have it switch between the two?"

**Before**: 
- "Look Down" was at `top: '35%'` (center of screen)
- Instructions were at `bottom: insets.bottom + 150` (above shutter)
- Messages in different locations

**After** (line 1556):
```javascript
position: 'absolute',
bottom: insets.bottom + 150, // Same position as instructions
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Both messages now in same location (above shutter button)
- ‚úÖ Clean crossfade between the two - no jumping
- ‚úÖ Not in the way when taking vertical photos

---

### 3. üìù Changed Message Text
**User Request**: "When it's in vertical mode, can it say 'aim down for auto level/capture'?"

**Before**: "Look Down"  
**After**: "Aim down for auto level/capture"

**Implementation** (line 1569):
```javascript
<Text style={{ color: 'white', fontSize: 14, fontWeight: '600', textAlign: 'center' }}>
  Aim down for auto level/capture
</Text>
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ More descriptive message
- ‚úÖ Explains WHY to aim down (auto level/capture feature)
- ‚úÖ Clearer user guidance
