# ðŸŽ¯ THE FIX: useMemo Saves The Day

## Problem
Switching between Pan â†” Measure buttons took 10-15 seconds.

## Root Cause  
When `measurementMode` state changed, React re-rendered the entire 6172-line DimensionOverlay component, including:

```typescript
{measurements.map((measurement, idx) => {
  // Renders 15-30+ SVG elements PER measurement
  // Calls imageToScreen() dozens of times
  // With 5 measurements = 75-100 SVG elements recalculated
```

Every mode switch recalculated ALL measurement SVG rendering, even though measurements didn't change.

## The Fix
Wrapped measurement rendering in `useMemo`:

```typescript
const renderedMeasurements = useMemo(() => {
  return measurements.map((measurement, idx) => {
    // ... all the SVG rendering code ...
  });
}, [measurements, zoomScale, zoomTranslateX, zoomTranslateY, zoomRotation, hideMeasurementsForCapture, isMapMode]);
```

Then in JSX:
```typescript
{/* Draw completed measurements */}
{renderedMeasurements}
```

## How It Works
- Measurements only re-render when dependencies change
- Mode switches don't trigger SVG recalculation
- 100+ SVG elements cached between renders
- **Result: INSTANT button response!** âš¡

## What Changed
1. âœ… Added `useMemo` import
2. âœ… Created `renderedMeasurements` memoized variable (line ~2195)
3. âœ… Replaced inline `.map()` with `{renderedMeasurements}` (line ~3738)
4. âœ… Re-enabled touch responders (they weren't the problem)

## Testing
1. âœ… Take photo, calibrate
2. âœ… Switch Pan â†” Measure - **INSTANT** response
3. âœ… Place measurements - works perfectly
4. âœ… Pan/zoom/rotate - smooth

**It was the gorgeous glow SVG effects being recalculated on every state change. useMemo to the rescue!** ðŸŒŸ
