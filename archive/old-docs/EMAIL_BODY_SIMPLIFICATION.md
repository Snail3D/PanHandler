# Email Body Simplification & Cleanup

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Problem

User feedback: The email body was confusing because:
1. Still said "US Quarter" instead of "the coin you selected"
2. "Pixels Per Unit" and "Canvas Scale" were redundant (same value shown twice)
3. Color names (Blue, Green, Red) didn't match actual measurement order
4. Too much technical info that users don't need

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Confusing Technical Info** 🧹

**Removed:**
- ❌ "Pixels Per Unit: 41.23 px/mm"
- ❌ "Canvas Scale: 41.23 px/mm" (duplicate!)
- ❌ "Image Resolution: 3024 × 4032 pixels"
- ❌ Color names in measurement list (Blue, Green, Red - confusing!)

**Why:** Users don't need pixel calculations. They just need the measurements and how to use them in CAD.

---

### 2. **Simplified Measurements List** 📝

**Before:**
```
Measurements:
-------------
1. 145.2mm (Blue)
2. 87.5° (Green)
3. ⌀ 52.3mm (Red)
```

**After:**
```
Measurements:
-------------
1. 145.2mm
2. 87.5°
3. ⌀ 52.3mm
```

**Why:** Color names were confusing because they don't match the actual order. The legend in the photo already shows the colors, so no need to repeat them in text.

---

### 3. **Added Clear Attachment Info** 📎

**New Section:**
```
Attached: 2 photos
  • Full measurements photo
  • Transparent CAD canvas (50% opacity)
```

**Why:** Makes it crystal clear what the two attachments are for.

---

### 4. **Simplified CAD Import Instructions** 🔧

**Before:**
```
═══ CAD Import Info ═══
The transparent photos can be imported as canvas backgrounds.
Calibrate using the reference coin:
  The coin you selected = 24.26mm diameter
```

**After:**
```
═══ CAD Import Info ═══
Import the transparent photo as a canvas background.
Use the alignment brackets to position it.
Scale by measuring the coin: 24.26mm diameter
```

**Why:** 
- More concise and actionable
- Mentions alignment brackets (key feature!)
- Clearer step-by-step flow

---

### 5. **Cleaner Footer** 🎨

**Before:**

**Why:** Less padding, shorter text, cleaner look.
