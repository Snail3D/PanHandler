# Easter Egg Moved to Help Modal - Quick Reference

## What Changed

### âœ… Before
- **Location**: Invisible tap area in top-right corner of DimensionOverlay
- **Activation**: Tap the invisible corner 5 times within 2 seconds
- **Problem**: Hard to find, not discoverable

### âœ… After  
- **Location**: Right egg (ðŸ¥š) in the "Hidden Surprises" section of Help Modal
- **Activation**: Tap the **right egg** 5 times within 2 seconds
- **Improvement**: Discoverable with hint text, consistent with easter egg theme

## How to Use It

1. Open the app
2. Tap the Help button (?) to open the Help Modal
3. Scroll down to the **"Hidden Surprises"** section near the bottom
4. You'll see: ðŸ¥š **Hidden Surprises** ðŸ¥š
5. **Tap the RIGHT egg (ðŸ¥š) 5 times rapidly** (within 2 seconds between taps)
6. You'll feel haptic feedback:
   - Light haptic for taps 1-2
   - Medium haptic for taps 3-4
   - Success/Warning haptic when toggled at tap 5

## What Happens

- **Free â†’ Pro**: Success haptic + Alert "ðŸŽ‰ Easter Egg Found! Pro features unlocked for testing!"
- **Pro â†’ Free**: Warning haptic + Alert "ðŸ¥š Back to Free - Pro features locked again."

## Testing Pro Features After Toggle

Once toggled to Pro:
- Freehand button shows no badge/limit
- Can use freehand measurement unlimited times
- No trial counter or special offer modals

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **`/home/user/workspace/src/components/HelpModal.tsx`**
   - Lines 2071-2110: Updated egg tap handler
   - Changed from 10 taps â†’ **5 taps**
   - Changed timeout from 1000ms â†’ **2000ms** (more forgiving)
   - Haptic feedback at 3+ taps instead of 5+

2. **`/home/user/workspace/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`**
   - Removed state: `rightCornerTapCount`, `rightCornerTapTimeoutRef`
   - Removed handler: `handleRightCornerTap()`
   - Removed invisible tap area (lines 5131-5143)

## Why This Is Better

1. **Discoverable**: Users naturally explore "Hidden Surprises" section
2. **Consistent**: Eggs in easter egg section makes thematic sense
3. **User-Friendly**: Hint text guides users ("Some badges hide secrets...")
4. **No Clutter**: Removes invisible tap area from main measurement screen
5. **Easier to Find**: TestFlight testers and reviewers can test Pro features easily
