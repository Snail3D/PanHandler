# Session Summary: Recalibrate Button & Privacy Section

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

## Overview
Completed two remaining features from the previous session:
1. Fixed recalibrate button behavior
2. Added Privacy & Security section to Help Modal

---

## 1. Recalibrate Button Fix ‚úÖ

### Problem
- Recalibrate button was calling `onReset()` which went back to camera screen
- User wanted it to go to calibration screen with the same photo (not lose the photo)

### Solution
- Modified `onReset` prop to accept optional `recalibrateMode` parameter
- When `recalibrateMode = true`:
  - Keeps `currentImageUri` in store
  - Clears `coinCircle` and `calibration` 
  - Resets zoom state
  - Switches to `zoomCalibrate` mode
  - Smooth fade transition (300ms black fade out, 500ms fade in)
- When `recalibrateMode = false` (default):
  - Full reset: clears everything and goes to camera (original behavior)

### Files Modified
1. **`src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`** (line 2455)
   - Changed `onReset()` to `onReset(true)` in recalibrate button
   - Updated prop type (line 96): `onReset?: (recalibrateMode?: boolean) => void`

2. **`src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`** (lines 973-1017)
   - Updated `onReset` callback to handle both modes
   - Added conditional logic for recalibrate vs full reset

### User Experience
- Tap "Recalibrate" ‚Üí Goes to calibration screen with same photo
- Tap "New Photo" ‚Üí Goes back to camera (full reset)
- Smooth black fade transitions maintain polish

---

## 2. Privacy & Security Section ‚úÖ

### Implementation
Added new section to Help Modal between "Calibration Tips" and "About PanHandler" sections.

### Content
- **Section Title**: Privacy & Security (with green shield icon)
- **Four Key Points**:
  1. üì± **Photos stay on your device** ‚Äî never uploaded or transferred to servers
  2. ‚úâÔ∏è **Email for sending only** ‚Äî email address never shared or sold
  3. üëÅÔ∏è **Zero tracking** ‚Äî no analytics on photos, files, or measurements
  4. ‚òÅÔ∏è **Works offline** ‚Äî lightweight and secure, everything runs locally

### Styling
- Green color theme (`#34C759`) to match security/privacy aesthetic
- Matches existing Help Modal design language
- Icon-based bullet points for each privacy feature
- White background with green shadow/border
- Fade-in animation delay: 650ms (between calibration tips and about section)

### Files Modified
**`src/components/HelpModal.tsx`** (lines 1629-1697)
- Added new `Privacy & Security` section
- Positioned after Calibration Tips, before About section
- Uses consistent styling with other Help Modal sections

## Technical Notes

### Recalibrate Implementation
- Used optional parameter pattern to maintain backward compatibility
- Default value `recalibrateMode = false` ensures existing "New Photo" behavior unchanged
- Kept smooth transitions with `transitionBlackOverlay` animation
- Proper cleanup of zoom state to ensure fresh calibration

### Privacy Section Styling
```tsx
shadowColor: '#34C759',      // Green shadow
borderColor: 'rgba(52, 199, 89, 0.2)',  // Green border
FadeIn.delay(650)            // Smooth entrance animation
```

### Icon Usage
- `shield-checkmark` - Section header
- `phone-portrait-outline` - Photos on device
- `mail-outline` - Email privacy
- `eye-off-outline` - No tracking
- `cloud-offline-outline` - Offline capability
