# v2.5.0 Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed
✅ Landscape orientation detection for crosshairs
✅ Landscape orientation detection for photo routing
✅ Initial camera screen fully working

## The Problem
- Taking a photo of a wall in **landscape** showed crosshairs (wrong)
- Taking a photo of a wall in **landscape** went to coin calibration (wrong)
- Portrait mode worked fine

## The Solution
Check **both** beta AND gamma angles to detect orientation:
```typescript
const nowHorizontal = absBeta < 45 && absGamma < 45;
```

## How It Works Now

**Looking DOWN at table**: Both axes < 45°
- ✅ Crosshairs visible
- ✅ Auto coin calibration

**Looking AT WALL** (portrait): Beta > 45°
- ✅ Crosshairs hidden
- ✅ Show photo menu

**Looking AT WALL** (landscape): Gamma > 45°
- ✅ Crosshairs hidden
- ✅ Show photo menu

## Files Changed
- `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx` - Lines 606-618, 1112-1126
- `app.json` - Version 2.5.0

## Status
✅ Camera screen working in all orientations
✅ Ready for production
✅ Do not revert

## Further Work Needed
User indicated there are still some fixes to go, but the initial camera flow is solid.
