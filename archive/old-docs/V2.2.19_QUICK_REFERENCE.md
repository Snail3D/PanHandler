# v2.2.19 Quick Reference - Polygon Fix

## Bug Fixed
**Polygon auto-detection was too aggressive** - it would automatically snap lines into triangles as soon as 3 lines connected, preventing users from building squares and other polygons.

## The Fix
**DISABLED automatic polygon detection** - Lines now stay as individual measurements, allowing you to build any polygon shape you want.

## What You Can Do Now
✅ Draw as many connected lines as you want  
✅ Build squares using 4 lines  
✅ Build pentagons, hexagons, or any polygon  
✅ Lines stay separate until YOU decide to merge them  

## Example Workflow (Now Fixed)
1. Draw Line 1 (top edge) ✓
2. Draw Line 2 (bottom edge) ✓
3. Draw Line 3 (left edge) ✓
4. **No auto-snap!** Lines stay separate ✓
5. Draw Line 4 (right edge) ✓
6. Complete your square! ✓

## Before vs After
**Before:** Drawing 3 connected lines → Auto-merged to triangle ❌  
**After:** Drawing 3+ connected lines → Stay as separate measurements ✅

## File Changed
`/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` - Line 1813 (commented out auto-detection)

## Full Session Summary

### v2.2.18 Features
1. **Undo single point** - Remove just the last point instead of entire measurement
2. **Feet/inches formatting** - Display as `45'1"` instead of `45.05 ft`

### v2.2.19 Bug Fix
3. **Polygon auto-detection disabled** - Lines no longer auto-merge into triangles

All changes tested and working! ✅
