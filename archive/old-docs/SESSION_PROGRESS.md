### Currently Working On (Option A - Full Fix List):
1. ðŸ”„ Fix fusion view rotation to match main view orientation
2. ðŸ”„ Fix label timing and wait times for fusion views (200ms + 100ms)
3. ðŸ”„ Reduce point glow by 50% (all measurement types)
4. ðŸ”„ Find and add glow to measurement cursor/crosshair
5. ðŸ”„ Make control menu swipeable from anywhere (>30% swipe threshold)
6. ðŸ”„ Fix menu collapse delay - make it instant
7. ðŸ”„ Add menu control instructions to Help modal

### Issues Encountered:
- File corruption during bulk edits (restored from git)
- Phantom TypeScript errors with 'freehand' type (code works, just IDE cache issue)

### Strategy:
Making careful, incremental changes to avoid file corruption. Testing each fix before moving to next.
