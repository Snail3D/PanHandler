## Phase 1: Prepare Your App

### 1.1 Update App Configuration

Edit `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "PanHandler",
    "slug": "panhandler",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "userInterfaceStyle": "automatic",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.panhandler",
      "buildNumber": "1",
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSCameraUsageDescription": "PanHandler needs camera access to take photos of objects for measurement.",
        "NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription": "PanHandler needs photo library access to save your measurement images.",
        "NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription": "PanHandler needs permission to save measurement images to your photo library."
      }
    },
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-image-picker",
        {
          "photosPermission": "The app needs access to your photos to save measurements.",
          "cameraPermission": "The app needs camera access to capture photos for measurement."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

**Important fields:**
- `bundleIdentifier`: Must be unique (use reverse domain notation: `com.yourname.panhandler`)
- `version`: User-facing version number (increment for each release: 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.0)
- `buildNumber`: Internal build number (increment for each build: 1, 2, 3...)

### 1.2 Create App Icons and Screenshots

**App Icon Requirements:**
- 1024x1024 PNG (no transparency)
- Use: https://www.appicon.co/ to generate all sizes

**Screenshot Requirements:**
- iPhone 6.7" (1290 x 2796 pixels) - iPhone 14 Pro Max
- iPhone 6.5" (1242 x 2688 pixels) - iPhone 11 Pro Max

## Phase 2: Test Your App

### 2.1 Test on Physical Device

Using Expo Go (Development):
```bash
# Start development server
bun start

# Scan QR code with your iPhone camera
# Test all features thoroughly
```

### 2.2 Create Development Build

For testing the actual app experience:
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo account
eas login

# Configure your project
eas build:configure

# Create iOS development build
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

Install the `.ipa` file on your device using TestFlight or direct installation.

---

## Phase 3: Build for Production

### 3.1 Create Production Build

```bash
# Create production build
eas build --profile production --platform ios
```

This will:
- Build your app on Expo's servers
- Generate an `.ipa` file ready for App Store submission
- Usually takes 10-20 minutes

### 3.2 Alternative: Build Locally (Advanced)

If you prefer to build locally:
```bash
# Generate iOS project files
npx expo prebuild --platform ios

# Open in Xcode
open ios/PanHandler.xcworkspace

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select "Any iOS Device (arm64)" as destination
# 2. Product > Archive
# 3. Wait for archive to complete
# 4. Click "Distribute App"
```
