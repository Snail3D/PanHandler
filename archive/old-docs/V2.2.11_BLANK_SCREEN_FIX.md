# V2.2.11 - Fixed Blank Screen After Photo Capture

## Issue
After taking a photo, the calibration screen was blank/stuck - user couldn't proceed.

## Root Cause
The bottom bar UI in ZoomCalibration.tsx was conditional on `selectedCoin`:
```typescript
{selectedCoin && (
  <View>{/* Bottom bar with LOCK IN, Map, Coin buttons */}</View>
)}
```

When a user took their **first photo** (no previous coin selection):
1. Photo captured → transitioned to `zoomCalibrate` mode ✅
2. ZoomCalibration component rendered ✅
3. But `selectedCoin` was `null` ❌
4. Bottom bar didn't render → blank screen ❌
5. User stuck, can't proceed ❌

## Fix
Auto-open coin selector when there's no coin selected:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (lastSelectedCoin) {
    const coin = getCoinByName(lastSelectedCoin);
    if (coin) {
      setSelectedCoin(coin);
    }
  } else {
    // No last selected coin - open selector automatically
    setShowCoinSelector(true);  // ← NEW
  }
}, [lastSelectedCoin]);
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### First Time User (No Previous Coin)
1. Take photo
2. Calibration screen loads
3. **Coin selector automatically fades in at top** ✅
4. User searches/selects coin
5. Selector fades out
6. Bottom bar appears with selected coin
7. User can calibrate and lock in

### Returning User (Has Last Coin)
1. Take photo
2. Calibration screen loads
3. Last selected coin auto-loaded
4. Bottom bar appears immediately
5. User can change coin by tapping coin button
