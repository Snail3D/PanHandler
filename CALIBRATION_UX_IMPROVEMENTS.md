# Calibration Screen UX Improvements ✅

## Date
October 16, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tutorial Text Blocking Coin Selector
**Problem**: The "Make sure the right coin is selected" tutorial text would fade away slowly (7 seconds), making it annoying when trying to quickly change coins.

**Fix**: Tutorial now dismisses immediately when user opens coin search
- Added `searchQuery` to the useEffect dependency
- Tutorial fades out in 800ms when user types in search box
- Clean, unobstructed view of coin selector

**Code**: Line 163-164
```typescript
if (showTutorial && (Math.abs(zoomScale - initialZoomScale.current) > 0.1 || searchQuery.trim().length > 0)) {
  // Dismiss tutorial when zooming OR when opening coin search
}
```

### 2. Coin Selection Hard to Tap
**Problem**: Coin dropdown items were small and closely spaced, making it difficult to tap the right coin. Had to tap exactly on the coin text.

**Improvements Made**:

#### Larger Tap Targets
- **Padding**: Increased from 12px to 16px (33% bigger)
- **Spacing**: Increased marginBottom from 8px to 10px (more separation)
- **Height**: Each item now ~60px tall instead of ~40px

#### Better Visual Feedback
- **Border**: Thicker borders (1.5px instead of 1px)
- **Shadow**: Added shadows for depth and tactile feel
- **Contrast**: Darker text (0.9 vs 0.85 opacity)
- **Font**: Bolder weights (700 instead of 600)
- **Font Size**: Larger text (15px/13px instead of 14px/12px)

#### More Coins Shown
- Increased from 4 coins to 5 coins visible
- Increased max height from 200px to 240px

**Code**: Lines 509-563
```typescript
paddingVertical: 16,      // Bigger tap area
paddingHorizontal: 16,    // Wider targets  
marginBottom: 10,         // More separation
borderRadius: 12,         // Larger radius
shadowColor: '#000',      // Added shadow
elevation: pressed ? 3 : 1, // Material depth
```

#### Persist Last Selected Coin
- Now saves user's coin choice with `setLastSelectedCoin(coin.name)`
- Next time user calibrates, their previous coin is pre-selected

### 3. Help Button Repositioned
**Problem**: Help button was in upper-left corner, conflicting with coin selector icon area.

**Fix**: Moved to upper-right corner
- Changed from `left:` to `right:` positioning
- Stays aligned with coin selector width
- Out of the way, but still easily accessible

**Before**:
```typescript
left: SCREEN_WIDTH * 0.15 + 8  // ❌ Left side
```

**After**:
```typescript
right: SCREEN_WIDTH * 0.15 + 8  // ✅ Right side
```

### 4. Improved Layer Management
**Problem**: When opening coin search, tutorial text could overlap and obstruct view.

**Fix**: Dynamic z-index management
- Coin selector gets z-index 1000 when search is active
- Coin selector has z-index 100 when closed
- Ensures dropdown is always on top when user is selecting

**Code**: Line 373
```typescript
zIndex: searchQuery.trim().length > 0 ? 1000 : 100
```

## Visual Improvements

### Coin Dropdown - Before vs After

**Before**:
- Small padding (12px)

### Typography Improvements
| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Coin Name | 14px, weight 600 | 15px, weight 700 |

7. Has to tap precisely on text
8. Frustrating experience

### After
1. User zooms in on coin

3. **Tutorial text disappears immediately (800ms)**
4. Clean, unobstructed dropdown appears
