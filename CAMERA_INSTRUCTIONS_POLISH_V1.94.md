---

## ✨ Implementation Details

### Updated Instruction Text

**Before:**
```
1. Place coin in center
2. Line up the lines
3. Press capture
```

**After:**
```
1. Place coin in center
2. Line up the lines
3. Tap to capture (hold for auto capture)
```

### Positioning Changes

**Before:**
- Position: `top: '30%'` (center of screen)
- Made instructions compete with coin placement circle for user's attention

**After:**
- Position: `bottom: insets.bottom + 150` (above shutter button)
- Natural reading flow: See instructions → Place coin → Tap shutter
- Instructions don't obscure the coin placement area

### Animation Behavior

**Added `instructionsOpacity` shared value** to control fade animation:

1. **On Press In** (User starts holding shutter):
   ```typescript
   instructionsOpacity.value = withTiming(0, {
     duration: 400,
     easing: Easing.out(Easing.ease),
   });
   ```
   - Instructions fade out gracefully over 400ms
   - Gives user clear view of alignment during hold
   - Creates focused, distraction-free capture experience

2. **On Press Out** (User releases shutter):
   ```typescript
   instructionsOpacity.value = withTiming(1, {
     duration: 400,
     easing: Easing.in(Easing.ease),
   });
   ```
   - Instructions fade back in smoothly
   - Ready for next capture attempt
   - Maintains helpful guidance

3. **On Mode Change** (Entering camera mode):
   ```typescript
   instructionsOpacity.value = 1; // Reset to visible
   ```
   - Ensures instructions always visible when returning to camera
   - Clean state reset

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

**src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx**

1. **Line 159-160**: Added `instructionsOpacity` shared value
   ```typescript
   const instructionsOpacity = useSharedValue(1);
   ```

2. **Line 879**: Reset instructions opacity when entering camera mode
   ```typescript
   instructionsOpacity.value = 1; // Reset instructions to visible
   ```

3. **Lines 1517-1542**: Updated instructions positioning and text
   - Changed `top: '30%'` → `bottom: insets.bottom + 150`
   - Updated opacity calculation to use `instructionsOpacity.value`
   - Changed text to include "(hold for auto capture)"

4. **Lines 1787-1791**: Fade out instructions on press in
   ```typescript
   instructionsOpacity.value = withTiming(0, {
     duration: 400,
     easing: Easing.out(Easing.ease),
   });
   ```

5. **Lines 1800-1804**: Fade in instructions on press out
   ```typescript
   instructionsOpacity.value = withTiming(1, {
     duration: 400,
     easing: Easing.in(Easing.ease),
   });
   ```

**app.json**
- Version bumped from 1.93 → 1.94

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Text Changes
- [x] Instruction #3 reads "Tap to capture (hold for auto capture)"
- [x] All three instructions visible and readable
- [x] Text properly formatted with parentheses

### Positioning
- [x] Instructions appear above shutter button
- [x] Instructions positioned between coin circle and shutter
- [x] "Look down" guidance banner stays in original position (above crosshairs)
- [x] Instructions don't overlap with coin placement circle
- [x] Instructions don't overlap with shutter button

### Animation Behavior
- [x] Instructions visible when camera loads
- [x] Instructions fade out smoothly when user holds shutter
- [x] Instructions fade back in when user releases shutter
- [x] Quick tap doesn't cause visible flicker
- [x] Instructions reset to visible when returning to camera mode

### Edge Cases
- [x] Vertical orientation: Instructions properly hidden (only show in horizontal)
- [x] During capture: Instructions behavior doesn't interfere
- [x] Fast tap/release: Animations cancel/restart smoothly
- [x] Multiple holds: Each hold triggers fade in/out correctly

## 💡 UX Improvements

### Before
❌ Instructions in center competed with coin placement  
❌ "Press capture" was ambiguous (press what? press how?)  
❌ Instructions stayed visible during hold, creating distraction  
❌ No indication that holding enables auto-capture

### After
✅ Instructions near shutter create natural flow  
✅ "Tap to capture" is clear and actionable  
✅ "(hold for auto capture)" explains advanced feature  
✅ Instructions fade during hold, reducing distraction  
✅ Clean, focused capture experience

---

## 📊 User Flow

### Standard Capture Flow
```
1. User sees instructions above shutter
2. Places coin in center circle
3. Aligns bubble level with crosshairs
4. Taps shutter button
5. Photo captured! ✅
```

### Auto-Capture Flow
```
1. User sees "(hold for auto capture)" in instructions
2. Places coin in center circle
3. Aligns bubble level roughly
4. HOLDS shutter button → Instructions fade out
5. Adjusts alignment while holding
6. Auto-capture triggers when perfectly aligned! ✅
7. Releases button → Instructions fade back in
```

## 🎯 Impact Summary

### Usability
- **Clearer instructions**: "Tap to capture (hold for auto capture)" is self-explanatory
- **Better positioning**: Natural eye flow from instructions → coin → shutter
- **Less distraction**: Instructions fade during hold for focused alignment

### Discoverability
- **Auto-capture feature**: Now explicitly mentioned in instructions
- **Hold mechanic**: Users learn about hold-to-auto-capture immediately

### Visual Polish
- **Smooth animations**: 400ms fade feels natural and responsive
- **Clean layout**: Instructions don't compete with coin placement area
- **Professional feel**: Attention to detail enhances perceived quality
