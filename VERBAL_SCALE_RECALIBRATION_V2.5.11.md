# Verbal Scale Recalibration Support (v2.5.11)

## Issue Discovery
While reviewing the recalibration logic, we discovered that **verbal scale (map scale) calibration did NOT recalculate existing measurements** when set, unlike blueprint scale which was fixed in v2.5.9-2.5.10.

## Current Behavior Analysis

### Calibration Types & Recalibration Behavior

| Calibration Type | Recalibration Method | Keeps Measurements? | Auto-Update Values? |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Coin** | Go back to coin screen | ❌ Clears all | N/A |
| **Verbal Scale** | Go back to camera | ❌ Clears all | ⚠️ **Was missing** |
| **Blueprint** | Place new points on photo | ✅ Keeps all | ✅ Yes (v2.5.9) |

### Why This Matters

While the current UI flow for verbal scale recalibration clears all measurements (user goes back to camera), adding the recalibration logic is important for:

1. **Consistency** - All calibration methods now use the same recalibration pattern
2. **Future-proofing** - If an "Edit Scale" feature is added later (to change scale without clearing measurements), it will work automatically
3. **Developer experience** - Same code pattern for all calibration types
4. **Edge cases** - Handles any workflow where measurements might exist when verbal scale is set

## Solution Implemented

Added measurement recalculation logic to the verbal scale `onComplete` handler, matching the blueprint recalibration pattern:

```typescript
setCalibration(newCalibration);

// Recalculate ALL existing measurements with new calibration
if (measurements.length > 0) {
  console.log('🔄 Recalculating', measurements.length, 'measurements with new verbal scale calibration');
  const recalibratedMeasurements = measurements.map(m => recalculateMeasurement(m, newCalibration));
  setMeasurements(recalibratedMeasurements);
  prevUnitSystemRef.current = null; // Force display update
  console.log('✅ Measurements recalculated with new verbal scale calibration');
}
```

## Code Changes

### File: `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` (Lines ~7274-7288)

**Before:**
```typescript
setCalibration(newCalibration);

Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success);
```

**After:**
```typescript
setCalibration(newCalibration);

// Recalculate ALL existing measurements with new calibration (same as blueprint recalibration)
if (measurements.length > 0) {
  console.log('🔄 Recalculating', measurements.length, 'measurements with new verbal scale calibration');
  const recalibratedMeasurements = measurements.map(m => recalculateMeasurement(m, newCalibration));
  setMeasurements(recalibratedMeasurements);
  prevUnitSystemRef.current = null;
  console.log('✅ Measurements recalculated with new verbal scale calibration');
}

Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success);
```

## Current Workflow Context

### When Verbal Scale is Set
1. User opens measurement screen
2. Clicks "Map Scale" button → Opens VerbalScaleModal
3. Enters scale (e.g., "1 cm = 10 km")
4. Modal calls `onComplete(scale)`
5. **NEW**: If measurements exist, they're recalculated with new scale
6. Calibration is set and stored

### When User Wants to "Recalibrate" Verbal Scale
Currently, pressing the "Recalibrate" button:
- Calls `onReset(false)` 
- Takes user back to camera
- Clears all measurements and calibration

**Future enhancement**: Could add an "Edit Scale" button that re-opens the VerbalScaleModal without clearing measurements, at which point the recalculation logic will be essential.

## Consistency Across All Calibration Types

Now all three calibration types follow the same pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Create new calibration object
const newCalibration = { ... };

// 2. Store calibration
setCalibration(newCalibration);

// 3. Recalculate existing measurements (if any)
if (measurements.length > 0) {
  const recalibratedMeasurements = measurements.map(m => 
    recalculateMeasurement(m, newCalibration)
  );
  setMeasurements(recalibratedMeasurements);
  prevUnitSystemRef.current = null; // Force UI update
}

// 4. Haptic feedback
Haptics.notificationAsync(...);
```

## Testing

Since the current UI clears measurements before setting verbal scale, the recalculation logic won't be triggered in normal use. However, it can be tested by:

1. **Blueprint test** (existing workflow):
   - Create measurements with blueprint scale
   - Recalibrate with new blueprint scale
   - ✅ Measurements update

2. **Potential future workflow** (if "Edit Scale" is added):
   - Create measurements with verbal scale
   - Edit the verbal scale (future feature)
   - ✅ Measurements would update automatically

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` (Lines ~7274-7288)
2. `app.json` - Version bumped to 2.5.11

## Version History
- v2.5.9: Blueprint recalibration display fix
- v2.5.10: Freehand recalibration support
- v2.5.11: Verbal scale recalibration consistency ✅ **Current**

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All calibration types now consistently recalculate measurements

## Future Considerations

If you want to add an "Edit Scale" feature in the future (to modify verbal scale without clearing measurements):

1. Add a button/modal to re-open VerbalScaleModal with current scale pre-filled
2. On submit, the existing recalculation logic will automatically update all measurements
3. No additional code needed - it's already implemented!

Example future UI flow:
```
[Current Scale: 1cm = 10km] [Edit] [Recalibrate]
                              ↓
                     [Opens VerbalScaleModal]
                              ↓
                   [User changes to 1cm = 5km]
                              ↓
              [Recalculation logic runs automatically]
                              ↓
                  [All measurements update instantly]
```
