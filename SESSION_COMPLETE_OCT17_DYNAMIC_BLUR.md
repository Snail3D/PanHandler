# Session Summary - Oct 17, 2025 (Dynamic Blur Effect)

## Completed Work

### v2.1.1 - Dynamic Blur Effect in Calibration Screen ✅

**What Was Done:**
Successfully resumed from previous session and verified implementation of the dynamic blur effect in the calibration screen.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Location**: `src/components/ZoomCalibration.tsx` (line 400)
- **Feature**: Blur overlay that intensifies with zoom level
- **Formula**: `Math.min(0.05 + (zoomScale - 1) * 0.18, 0.50)`
- **Effect**: Starts at 5% blur (1x zoom), reaches 50% blur (3.5x zoom)
- **Focal Point**: Coin circle area stays crystal clear (via SVG mask)

**Technical Approach:**
1. SVG Mask keeps coin area clear (black = hidden, white = visible)
2. Rect overlay with dynamic opacity based on `zoomScale` state
3. Linear progression: 0.18 opacity increase per zoom unit
4. Capped at 50% maximum blur for optimal visual effect

- Horizontal mode: Hold enables auto-capture
- Vertical mode: Hold does NOT enable auto-capture

### v2.0.9 - Graceful Orientation Transitions
- Smooth 400ms fade transitions for red level lines
- Eliminated jarring visual transitions

### v2.0.8 - Cache Clear & Capture Fix

## Key Technical Details

### Blur Formula Breakdown:
```javascript
// Dynamic opacity calculation
const blurOpacity = Math.min(
  0.05 +                    // Base: 5% at 1x zoom
  (zoomScale - 1) * 0.18,   // Rate: +18% per zoom unit
  0.50                      // Cap: 50% maximum
);

// Applied to Rect overlay
fill={`rgba(255, 255, 255, ${blurOpacity})`}
```

### Zoom Scale vs Blur Table:
| Zoom | Calculation | Opacity | Visual |
|------|-------------|---------|--------|
| 1.0x | 0.05 + (0) × 0.18 | 5% | Subtle |
| 1.5x | 0.05 + (0.5) × 0.18 | 14% | Light |
| 2.0x | 0.05 + (1.0) × 0.18 | 23% | Moderate |
| 2.5x | 0.05 + (1.5) × 0.18 | 32% | Strong |
| 3.0x | 0.05 + (2.0) × 0.18 | 41% | Very Strong |
| 3.5x | 0.05 + (2.5) × 0.18 | 50% | Maximum |

### SVG Mask Implementation:
```javascript
// Mask definition (lines 387-389)
<Mask id="circleMask">
  <Rect fill="white" />     // Everything visible
  <Circle fill="black" />   // Coin area hidden (clear)
</Mask>

// Overlay (lines 395-402)
<Rect 
  fill={dynamicBlur}
  mask="url(#circleMask)"   // Only affects non-coin areas
/>
```

## Testing Status

### Visual Verification Needed:
- [ ] Test at 1.0x zoom → should see minimal blur (5%)
- [ ] Test at 2.0x zoom → should see moderate blur (~23%)
- [ ] Test at 3.5x zoom → should see strong blur (50%)
- [ ] Verify coin circle stays clear at all zoom levels
- [ ] Check smooth blur transition during pinch zoom

### Expected User Experience:
- ✅ Natural depth-of-field effect mimics camera focus
- ✅ Draws attention to coin as clear focal point
- ✅ Smooth, gradual blur increase (no steps)
- ✅ "Super sexy" visual polish as requested

## Session Context

**Starting Point:**
- Previous session left off with dynamic blur formula already in code
- Formula was implemented but not verified/documented
- Version was still at 2.1.0

**This Session:**
- Verified implementation was correct
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Bumped version to 2.1.1
- Created quick reference guide

**Session Duration:**
- Short verification/documentation session
- No code changes needed (implementation was already correct)
- Focus on documentation and version management

---

## Next Steps (If Needed)

1. **User Testing**: Get feedback on blur effect
2. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust formula if needed (rate, min, max)
3. **Performance**: Monitor if dynamic formula causes any lag
4. **Polish**: Consider adding blur to other zoom contexts

---

## Notes

- Implementation was already complete from previous session
- Formula is mathematically sound: `(0.50 - 0.05) / (3.5 - 1) = 0.18`
- SVG mask ensures coin area is never blurred
- Linear progression provides smooth, predictable effect
- White blur (`rgba(255, 255, 255, ...)`) creates glassmorphic overlay
- Works seamlessly with existing zoom state management

---
