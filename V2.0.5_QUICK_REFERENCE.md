## Visual Comparison

### Horizontal Mode (Looking Down)
```
[ Center of screen ]
    Gray crosshairs ✅
    Red level lines ✅

[ Above shutter button ]
    Instructions ✅
    "1. Place coin..."
    "2. Line up..."
    "3. Tap to capture"
    "(hold for auto)"
```

### Vertical Mode (Upright)
```
[ Center of screen ]
    Clean view ✅
    (no crosshairs/lines)

```

## Testing

1. **Tilt phone upright** → Crosshairs fade out, see "Aim down" message
2. **Tilt phone down** → Crosshairs fade in, message changes to instructions
3. **Watch transition** → Smooth crossfade in same location, no jumping
4. **Take vertical photo** → Clean UI, quick tap works

## Version
Previous: 2.0.4 → Current: **2.0.5**

## Key Benefit
Clean, unobtrusive UI in vertical mode while maintaining full functionality in horizontal mode
