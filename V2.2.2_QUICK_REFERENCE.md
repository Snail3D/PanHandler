# PanHandler v2.2.2 - Quick Reference

**Release Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Focus**: Blueprint Cursor System Integration

## What Changed

### Blueprint Pin Placement Now Uses Measurement Cursor

Blueprint scale setup now works **exactly like distance/angle/circle tools**:

- ‚úÖ Press and hold ‚Üí **gray cursor appears above finger**
- ‚úÖ Release ‚Üí **point is placed**
- ‚úÖ Helper text shows: "Place first point" / "Place second point"
- ‚úÖ Gray visual theme (crosshairs, points, line)
- ‚ùå No more direct tap to place
- ‚ùå No more separate instructional overlay

## How to Test Blueprint Scale

1. **Start**: Tap "Map Scale" button ‚Üí Select "Blueprint"
2. **Ready Screen**: Modal shows "PLACE PINS NOW" button
3. **Place First Point**:
   - Tap "PLACE PINS NOW"
   - Gray cursor appears in center of screen
   - Press and hold anywhere ‚Üí cursor follows finger
   - Release ‚Üí First gray point placed
4. **Place Second Point**:
   - Gray cursor reappears with "Place second point"
   - Press and hold ‚Üí cursor follows
   - Release ‚Üí Second point placed, gray line connects them
5. **Enter Distance**:
   - Distance modal automatically appears
   - Enter known distance (e.g., "10")
   - Select unit (mm, cm, in, m, ft, km, mi)
   - Tap "LOCK IN"
6. **Done**: Gray line fades out, calibration saved

## Visual Differences

### Blueprint Mode (Gray)
- Cursor: Gray crosshairs with gray glow
- Points: Gray circles with white center
- Line: Gray dashed line
- Helper: Gray background with white text

### Regular Measurements (Colored)
- Cursor: Vibrant colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, etc.)
- Points: Colored with glow effects
- Lines: Colored solid/dashed
- Helper: Colored background matching measurement

## Badge Display

After blueprint calibration, the calibration badge shows:
```
üìê Blueprint Scale
10cm between points
```

## Technical Changes

### What Got Fixed
1. Blueprint now enters **measurement mode** (like distance tool)
2. Uses existing **cursor system** (not direct tap)
3. Points stored in **image coordinates** (zoom/pan compatible)
4. Gray visual theme **differentiates** from regular measurements
5. Removed **conflicting touch overlay**
6. Integrated **helper text into cursor**

### Files Modified
- `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` (main changes)

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before v2.2.2 (WRONG)
```
User taps "PLACE PINS NOW"
  ‚Üì
Screen has separate touch overlay
  ‚Üì
User taps screen ‚Üí point placed immediately
  ‚Üì
User taps again ‚Üí second point placed
  ‚Üì
Distance modal appears
```

### After v2.2.2 (CORRECT)
```
User taps "PLACE PINS NOW"
  ‚Üì
Measurement mode activates
  ‚Üì
Gray cursor appears above finger
  ‚Üì
User releases ‚Üí first point placed
  ‚Üì
Gray cursor reappears
  ‚Üì
User releases ‚Üí second point placed
  ‚Üì
Distance modal appears
```

## Map Scale Button Behavior

The "Map Scale" button toggles map tools mode:
- **First tap** (no calibration): Opens scale setup modal
- **With calibration**: Toggles map tools ON/OFF
- **Does NOT reopen** scale setup each time

## Known Issues

None - blueprint cursor system fully integrated.

## Next Version Preview

Future improvements might include:
- Multiple blueprint references per project
- Blueprint scale editing/adjustment
- Named blueprint scales (e.g., "Floor Plan A")
