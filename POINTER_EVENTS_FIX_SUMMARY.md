# Button Fix Complete - Quick Summary

## Problem
Buttons in the menu were completely unresponsive after panning. User couldn't tap anything.

## Solution
**File**: `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` (Line 4567)

Changed:
```typescript
pointerEvents="box-none"  // ❌ Blocks everything
```

To:
```typescript
pointerEvents="auto"  // ✅ Works properly
```

## What Was Wrong
The menu container had `pointerEvents="box-none"` which:
- Blocks GestureDetector from working
- Blocks Pressable buttons from responding
- Creates invisible touch event conflicts

## Result
✅ All buttons now work instantly
✅ No lag, no lockup, no delay
✅ Gestures still work properly

## Testing
Open the menu and tap any button - should respond immediately:
- Pan/Measure toggle
- All mode buttons (Box, Circle, Angle, Line, Freehand)
- Undo button
- Hide menu button
- All toggles

**The fix is live and ready to test!** 🎯
