# v2.1.8 Quick Reference

## What Changed
**Label tap interaction improved** - Fixed blocking UX issue

## Key Changes

### Label Editing Now Requires Double-Tap
- **Before**: Single tap on label OR 2 taps on line opened editor
- **After**: Only double-tap on LABEL opens editor

### Line/Shape Delete Workflow Fixed
- **Before**: 2 taps on line opened editor (blocked 4-tap delete)
- **After**: 4 taps on line/shape successfully deletes measurement

## User Actions

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| 2 taps on **LABEL** | Opens label editor ✅ |
| 4 taps on **LINE/SHAPE** | Deletes measurement ✅ |
| Single tap on label | Nothing (waiting for 2nd tap) |

## Haptic Pattern
- **1st tap on label**: Light haptic (registered)
- **2nd tap on label**: Medium haptic (editor opens)

## Technical
- Added `labelTapState` tracking (300ms timeout)
- Double-tap detection similar to delete tap pattern
- Only works when NOT in measurement mode

## Testing Focus
1. Double-tap label → opens editor
2. 4-tap line → deletes (no editor interference)
3. Haptics feel natural
