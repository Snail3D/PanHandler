# Version 1.91 - Press-and-Hold Auto-Capture & UX Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced camera UX with press-and-hold auto-capture feature, fixed photo picker workflow, and added automatic album opening for saved photos.

## New Features

### 1. 🎯 Press-and-Hold Auto-Capture
**User can now hold the shutter button to enable auto-capture when lines align**

#### How It Works
- **Quick Tap** (< 200ms): Takes photo immediately (same as before)
- **Press & Hold**: Enables auto-capture mode
  - Button border changes to crosshair color (visual feedback)
  - Photo automatically captures when:
    - Bubble level is centered (`alignmentStatus === 'good'`)
    - Phone is stable (`isStable === true`)
  - Release button to cancel auto-capture

#### Visual Feedback
- **Normal State**: Shutter button uses contrasting color (from v1.90 color system)
- **Holding State**: Border and inner circle change to crosshair color
- **Haptic Feedback**: Light haptic on press-in, medium haptic on quick-tap capture

#### Implementation
- Added `onPressIn` and `onPressOut` handlers to shutter button
- `isHoldingShutter` state tracks if user is holding button
- `holdStartTimeRef` tracks hold duration for quick-tap detection
- Auto-capture useEffect monitors `isHoldingShutter` instead of manual toggle
- Button styling updates dynamically based on hold state

### 2. 📸 Fixed Photo Picker Workflow
**Photo library button now goes directly to calibration**

#### Before v1.91
- Tapping photo library button opened picker
- After selecting photo, no smooth transition
- User was left in ambiguous state

#### After v1.91
- Smooth transition to calibration screen after photo selection
- Uses same cinematic fade as taking photo
- Black overlay → Calibration fade-in (500ms)
- `setImageUri` properly marks photo as not auto-captured

#### Implementation
```typescript
const pickImage = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({ ... });
    if (!result.canceled && result.assets[0]) {
      setImageUri(result.assets[0].uri, false); // false = not auto-captured
      await detectOrientation(result.assets[0].uri);
      
      // Smooth transition to calibration
      setIsTransitioning(true);
      transitionBlackOverlay.value = withTiming(1, { duration: 300 });
      setTimeout(() => {
        setMode('zoomCalibrate');
        transitionBlackOverlay.value = withTiming(0, { duration: 500 });
      }, 300);
    }
  } catch (error) { ... }
};
```

### 3. 📂 Automatic Album Opening
**Photos now save to "PanHandler" album and album opens automatically**

#### Features
- All photos save to dedicated "PanHandler" album
- Album created automatically on first photo
- iOS: Attempts to open Photos app after save (`photos-redirect://`)
- Android: Graceful fallback (photo still saves, album accessible in gallery)
- Error handling: If album creation fails, photo saves to camera roll

#### Implementation
```typescript
// Save to "PanHandler" album
let album = await MediaLibrary.getAlbumAsync('PanHandler');
if (album) {
  await MediaLibrary.addAssetsToAlbumAsync([asset], album, false);
} else {
  album = await MediaLibrary.createAlbumAsync('PanHandler', asset, false);
}

// Open album on iOS
if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
  await Linking.openURL('photos-redirect://');
}
```

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
- `/home/user/workspace/src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`
  - Added `Linking` import
  - Added `holdStartTimeRef` for hold duration tracking
  - Removed unused `albumName` state (hardcoded to 'PanHandler')
  - Updated shutter button with `onPressIn`/`onPressOut` handlers
  - Updated auto-capture useEffect to monitor `isHoldingShutter`
  - Updated pickImage function with smooth transition
  - Updated MediaLibrary save to use "PanHandler" album + auto-open

### State Variables
- **Added**: `holdStartTimeRef` - Tracks when user started holding shutter
- **Updated**: `isHoldingShutter` - Now actively used for auto-capture
- **Removed**: Unused `autoCaptureEnabled` toggle behavior

### Visual Design
- Shutter button border: `shutterColor.glow` → `crosshairColor.main` when holding
- Inner circle: `shutterColor.glow` → `crosshairColor.glow` when holding
- Provides clear visual feedback that auto-capture mode is active

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Quick Photo (Manual Capture)
1. User taps shutter button quickly (< 200ms)
2. Photo captures immediately
3. Transitions to calibration screen
4. Photo saved to "PanHandler" album
5. iOS: Photos app opens (shows album)

### Scenario 2: Auto-Capture (Hold for Perfect Alignment)
1. User presses and holds shutter button
2. Button changes to crosshair color (visual confirmation)
3. User adjusts phone position while holding
4. Bubble level guidance shows alignment status
5. When lines align perfectly (bubble centered):
   - Photo automatically captures
   - Light haptic feedback
6. Transitions to calibration screen
7. Photo saved to "PanHandler" album
8. iOS: Photos app opens

### Scenario 3: Import from Library
1. User taps photo library button (bottom-left)
2. Photo picker opens
3. User selects photo
4. Smooth black transition
5. Calibration screen appears with selected photo
6. No save to album (imported photo, not new capture)

## Benefits

### For Users
✨ **More Control**: Choose between quick capture or wait for perfect alignment
🎯 **Better Photos**: Auto-capture ensures optimal level/alignment
📸 **Smooth Workflow**: No confusion after importing photos
📂 **Organization**: All photos in one dedicated album
🔍 **Quick Access**: Album opens automatically (iOS)

### For Developers
✅ **Cleaner Code**: Removed unused auto-capture toggle logic
✅ **Better UX**: Haptic and visual feedback for all states
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for album creation
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on both iOS and Android

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Quick tap shutter (< 200ms) takes photo immediately
- [ ] Press and hold changes button to crosshair color
- [ ] Release without alignment cancels auto-capture
- [ ] Hold until aligned automatically takes photo
- [ ] Photo library button opens picker
- [ ] Selected photo transitions to calibration smoothly
- [ ] Photos save to "PanHandler" album
- [ ] iOS: Photos app opens after save
- [ ] Android: Photos save successfully (no app opening)
- [ ] Album created automatically on first photo
- [ ] Error handling works if album creation fails

## Known Limitations

1. **iOS Album Opening**: Uses generic `photos-redirect://` which opens Photos app but not the specific album. iOS doesn't provide a direct URL scheme to open a specific album by name.

2. **Android**: No automatic app opening. Users must manually navigate to gallery to view album.

3. **Hold Duration Detection**: 200ms threshold for quick-tap vs hold. May need adjustment based on user feedback.

## Future Enhancements

- Add visual indicator (progress ring) around shutter button when holding
- Show alignment status text when holding (e.g., "Hold steady... Almost there...")
- Vibration pattern on successful auto-capture (double-pulse)
- Settings to adjust quick-tap threshold (200ms configurable)
- Deep link to specific album on iOS (if Apple adds API support)

## Version
**1.91** (October 17, 2025)

## Backwards Compatibility
✅ All v1.90 features preserved
✅ Color system unchanged
✅ No breaking changes to existing workflows
