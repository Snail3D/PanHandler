# Email Coin Reference Update

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Change

Updated the email measurement report to use generic text "the coin you selected" instead of the specific coin name (e.g., "US Quarter").

---

## Why This Change?

**User Request:** Rather than say "US Quarter", use more generic text like "the coin you selected" in the email body.

**Benefit:** Makes the text more universal and less specific to one coin type, which is cleaner and more professional.

---

## What Was Changed

### Location 1: Calibration Reference Header (Line 1354)

**Before:**
```
Calibration Coin: US Quarter (24.26mm)
```

**After:**
```
Calibration Reference: 24.26mm (the coin you selected)
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ "Calibration Coin:" → "Calibration Reference:"
- ✅ Coin name removed
- ✅ Diameter shown first
- ✅ Added "(the coin you selected)" for context

---

### Location 2: CAD Import Info Footer (Line 1374)

**Before:**
```
═══ CAD Import Info ═══
The transparent photos can be imported as canvas backgrounds.
Calibrate using the reference coin:
  US Quarter = 24.26mm diameter
```

**After:**
```
═══ CAD Import Info ═══
The transparent photos can be imported as canvas backgrounds.
Calibrate using the reference coin:
  The coin you selected = 24.26mm diameter
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ "US Quarter" → "The coin you selected"
- ✅ Rest of the text remains the same

- Specific coin name shown (e.g., "US Quarter", "Euro 1 Cent", etc.)
- Could be confusing if user doesn't remember which coin they used
- Less universal language

### After Change
- ✅ Generic, professional language
- ✅ "The coin you selected" reminds user of their calibration choice
- ✅ Diameter is still clearly shown (most important info)
- ✅ Works for any coin from any country
- ✅ Cleaner, more universal text

## Technical Details

### File Modified
**`/home/user/workspace/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`**

### Lines Changed
- **Line 1354:** Header calibration reference
- **Line 1374:** CAD import info footer

### Variables Used
- `coinCircle.coinDiameter` - Still used for the diameter value
- `coinCircle.coinName` - Removed (was previously used)

---

## User Experience

When users receive the email, they'll see:
1. **Clear diameter measurement** - The actual size is prominent
2. **Generic reference** - "the coin you selected" instead of specific name
3. **Still actionable** - They can use the diameter for CAD calibration
4. **More professional** - Universal language works for all coins
