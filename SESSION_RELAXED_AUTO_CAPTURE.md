# Session Complete: Much Less Sensitive Auto-Capture

**Date**: October 16, 2025

## Problem
Auto-capture was WAY too sensitive and strict, making it frustrating to use. It required near-perfect stillness and precision, causing it to wait too long before capturing.

## Solution
Made the auto-capture significantly more forgiving across all parameters:

### Changes Made

#### 1. Angle Tolerance (Tilt Requirements)
**Before:**
- Good: ≤ 2° (extremely strict)
- Warning: ≤ 10°
- Bad: > 10°

**After:**
- Good: ≤ 5° (150% more forgiving)
- Warning: ≤ 15° (50% more forgiving)
- Bad: > 15°

#### 2. Motion Stability (Hand Movement)
**Before:**
- Motion threshold: 0.2 (still too strict)
- Accessibility: 0.35

**After:**
- Motion threshold: 0.4 (100% more forgiving)
- Accessibility: 0.6 (allows even more movement)

#### 3. Sample Requirements (Response Time)
**Before:**
- Required 5 samples before checking stability

**After:**
- Required 3 samples (captures 40% faster)

#### 4. Angle Stability Window
**Before:**
- Angle variance: ≤ 2° (very strict)
- Accessibility: ≤ 5°

**After:**
- Angle variance: ≤ 5° (150% more forgiving)
- Accessibility: ≤ 8° (60% more forgiving)

## Files Modified

### `/home/user/workspace/src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`

1. **Lines 574-594**: Relaxed stability detection
   ```typescript
   // Sample requirement: 5 → 3 (faster response)
   if (recentAngles.current.length >= 3 && recentAccelerations.current.length >= 3) {
     
     // Angle stability: 2° → 5° (much more forgiving)
     const angleThreshold = isAccessibilityMode ? 8 : 5;
     
     // Motion threshold: 0.2 → 0.4 (allows natural hand movement)
     const motionThreshold = isAccessibilityMode ? 0.6 : 0.4;
   }
   ```

2. **Lines 601-612**: Relaxed alignment status
   ```typescript
   // Good status: 2° → 5° (captures sooner)
   if (absTilt <= 5) status = 'good';
   // Warning: 10° → 15°
   else if (absTilt <= 15) status = 'warning';
   ```

## Technical Summary

| Parameter | Before | After | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Angle Tolerance (Good)** | 2° | 5° | +150% |
| **Angle Tolerance (Warning)** | 10° | 15° | +50% |
| **Motion Threshold** | 0.2 | 0.4 | +100% |
| **Motion (Accessibility)** | 0.35 | 0.6 | +71% |
| **Angle Stability** | 2° | 5° | +150% |
| **Angle (Accessibility)** | 5° | 8° | +60% |
| **Sample Requirement** | 5 | 3 | -40% |

## User Experience

### Before:
- Required near-perfect stillness
- Had to hold phone extremely level (within 2°)
- Waited forever before capturing
- Frustrating and overly strict

### After:
- ✅ Captures much sooner
- ✅ Allows natural hand movements
- ✅ More forgiving tilt tolerance (5° instead of 2°)
- ✅ Faster response time (3 samples instead of 5)
- ✅ Much more usable and natural feeling

## Testing Results

The auto-capture should now:
1. Trigger much faster when you're reasonably level
2. Not be overly picky about tiny tilts
3. Allow normal hand movements without waiting forever
4. Feel natural and responsive instead of overly strict

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Auto-capture is now **much less sensitive** and should trigger way sooner with reasonable levelness and stability.
