# V2.2.10 - Fixed Opening Quote Screen Lockup

## Issue
Opening quote screen was locking up and not displaying typing animation.

## Root Cause
Line 241 in App.tsx was attempting to access `introOpacity.value` directly in the render:
```typescript
pointerEvents={introOpacity.value > 0.5 ? 'auto' : 'none'}
```

This is incorrect usage of Reanimated shared values - `.value` can only be accessed inside worklets/animated styles, not in regular render logic.

## Fix
Removed the problematic `pointerEvents` prop from the intro Animated.View:

**Before:**
```typescript
<Animated.View
  style={[...]}
  pointerEvents={introOpacity.value > 0.5 ? 'auto' : 'none'}  // ❌ Error
>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<Animated.View
  style={[...]}
>
```

## Why This Works
- The intro screen is conditionally rendered with `{showIntro && ...}`
- When `showIntro` is false, the entire component is removed from the tree
- We don't need `pointerEvents` management because the component is fully mounted/unmounted
- Tapping anywhere on the screen still triggers `skipIntro()` via the Pressable wrapper

## Expected Behavior Now
1. App loads → White screen fades in
2. Quote types out character by character (25ms speed)
3. Haptic feedback on characters (every 3rd char + punctuation)
4. After typing completes → 2 second pause
5. Intro fades out, main app fades in
6. User can tap anywhere to skip immediately
