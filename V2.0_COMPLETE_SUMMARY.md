# Version 2.0 - Feature Summary & Improvements

## What We Built Today 🚀

### 1. **Bubble Level Y-Axis Fix** ✅
**File**: `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`
- Fixed vertical mode physics so bubble moves naturally up/down when phone is upright
- Proper beta angle calculation for portrait orientation

### 2. **Removed Shutter Button - Auto-Capture Only** ✅
**Files**: 
- `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`
- `src/components/HelpModal.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed hold-to-capture button
- Simple instructional text: "Position object + coin in frame, then level phone to auto-capture"
- Haptics still provide "hot/cold" guidance as you level
- Photo captures automatically when perfectly level + stable
- Much more intuitive UX!

### 3. **Cinematic Morph Transition** 🎬
**File**: `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`

**What It Does**:
- Camera flash effect (150ms)
- Camera view smoothly fades out revealing captured photo underneath
- Subtle zoom morph (1.0 → 1.05 → 1.0) for cinematic feel
- Calibration UI appears over same photo
- No jarring black screen - photo "freezes" in place seamlessly

**Timeline**:
- 0ms: Flash starts
- 200ms: Morph begins (camera opacity + scale animation)
- 500ms: Mode switches to calibration
- 800ms: Transition complete

### 4. **Glassmorphic Focus Overlay on Calibration** 🪟
**File**: `src/components/ZoomCalibration.tsx`

**What It Does**:
- Added translucent white overlay OUTSIDE the calibration circle
- Creates clear "window" that naturally focuses attention on coin alignment
- SVG mask creates perfect circular cutout
- Beautiful focal point effect

### 5. **Smart Instruction Text (Zoom-Responsive)** 📖
**File**: `src/components/ZoomCalibration.tsx`

**What It Does**:
- Tutorial text fades out when user zooms in (> 1.15x)
- Fades back in at 50% opacity when user zooms out (< 1.15x)
- Stays readable but not obtrusive
- Helps users who forget instructions

### 6. **Reduced Error Detection Sensitivity** ✅
**File**: `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Distance mode: Now requires 4 attempts (was 2)
- Other modes: Now requires 5 attempts (was 3)
- Less false positives when lines cross naturally

### 7. **Banner Click-Through Fix** ✅
**File**: `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `pointerEvents="none"` to banner content
- Can now tap the banner itself to dismiss (not just around it)
- "Tap anywhere to dismiss" actually works now!

### 8. **Removed 5-Tap Easter Egg from Control Menu** ✅
**File**: `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed confusing 5-tap Pro toggle from footer
- Simplified to just show Pro modal on tap
- Removed state variables causing blur/freeze bug
- 10-tap easter egg still in Help Modal for testing

### 9. **Progressive Special Offer System** 🎉💰
**Files**:
- `src/state/measurementStore.ts` - Session tracking + offer state
- `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx` - Banner UI + logic
- `src/components/TypewriterText.tsx` - Typewriter effect component

**How It Works**:
- Tracks session count (every app open)
- At session 50: Special offer activates for free users
- Shows banner with typewriter effect (like opening quotes)
- Progressive pricing over 3 sessions:

**Session 50** ($6.97):
```
⚠️ ERROR: Squiggly Line Not Found

We noticed you haven't tried our fancy freehand tool yet. 
You know... for when straight lines are just too mainstream.

⏰ 3 sessions to decide
```

**Session 51** ($5.97):
```
💪 You're Twisting Our Arm

Alright tough guy, we'll drop it even MORE. 
But seriously, this squiggly line is pretty cool...

⏰ Only 2 sessions left!
```

**Session 52** ($4.97):
```
🚨 LAST CHANCE ALERT

This is it. Final price. We're basically giving it away. 
After this? Full price forever.

⏰ LAST SESSION
```

**Session 53+**: Offer gone forever

**Banner Features**:
- Same style as calibration error banner (cohesive!)
- Fancy squiggly line SVG illustration
- Typewriter text effect (25ms per character)
- Appears 2 seconds after app opens
- Tap anywhere to dismiss
- Smooth slide-in animation
- Only shows to free users in measurement mode

## Known Issues / Future Improvements

1. **Payment buttons don't work yet**
   - Banner has no "Buy Now" button
   - Need to wire up IAP when stores are ready

2. **No receipt validation**
   - Currently just toggles boolean
   - Need server-side validation for security

3. **Special offer testing**
   - Need to manually change session count to test
   - Add dev button to reset session count?

4. **Typewriter speed**
   - Currently 25ms per character
   - May want to make adjustable per-offer

5. **Banner positioning**
   - Currently top of screen
   - May want bottom for easier thumb reach?
