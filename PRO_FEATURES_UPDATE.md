# Help Modal - Pro Features Update

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Update:** Accurate Pro features + comparison chart + upgrade/restore links

## ✅ What Changed

### 1. **Corrected Pro Features**

Clean table showing Free vs Pro:

|---------|------|-----|
| Monthly Saves | 10 | ∞ |
| Monthly Emails | 10 | ∞ |
| Measurements | ∞ | ∞ |
| All Measurement Types | ✓ | ✓ |
| Coin Calibration | ✓ | ✓ |
| Fusion 360 Export | ✓ | ✓ |

**Design:**
- Subtle borders and backgrounds
- Orange highlight for Pro column
- Clean typography
- Scannable layout

### 3. **Added Action Buttons**

**Upgrade to Pro Button:**
```typescript
onPress={() => {
  // TODO: Implement Pro upgrade
  console.log('Upgrade to Pro tapped');
}}
```
- Orange (#FF9500) with hover state
- Prominent placement
- Clear call-to-action

**Restore Purchase Link:**
```typescript
onPress={() => {
  // TODO: Implement restore purchase
  console.log('Restore purchase tapped');
}}
```
- Blue text link (#007AFF)
- Standard iOS styling
- Below upgrade button

### 4. **Simplified Design**
- Removed garish gold gradient background
- Clean white card with subtle orange accent
- Matches the refined Help modal aesthetic
- Professional and trustworthy

## 🎨 Visual Design

**Card Style:**
- Background: `rgba(255,255,255,0.95)` (subtle translucency)
- Border: `rgba(255,149,0,0.2)` (soft orange)
- Shadow: Soft 12px blur
- Radius: 18px (consistent with other cards)

**Comparison Table:**
- Header row: Light gray background
- Pro column: `rgba(255,149,0,0.08)` orange tint
- Borders: Ultra-subtle `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`
- Clean, scannable layout

**Price Display:**
- Large 24px bold price
- Subtitle: "One-time payment • Lifetime access"
- Centered for emphasis

## 📊 New Component: ComparisonRow

Created reusable comparison row component:

```typescript
const ComparisonRow = ({ 
  feature, 
  free, 
  pro,
  last = false 
}: { 
  feature: string; 
  free: string; 
  pro: string;
  last?: boolean;
}) => (
  // 3-column row with feature name + free value + pro value
);
```

**Used 6 times for all feature comparisons**

## 🔗 Integration Points

### For You to Implement:

**1. Upgrade Button:**
```typescript
// In onPress handler for "Upgrade to Pro" button
// Replace console.log with actual in-app purchase logic
// Likely using expo-in-app-purchases or RevenueCat
```

**2. Restore Purchase:**
```typescript
// In onPress handler for "Restore Purchase" link
// Implement restore purchase flow
// Check if user has already purchased Pro
```

**3. Show Pro Badge (Optional):**
You might want to hide these buttons if user is already Pro:
```typescript
const isProUser = useStore((s) => s.isProUser);

{!isProUser && (
  <>
    <Pressable onPress={handleUpgrade}>
      Upgrade to Pro
    </Pressable>
    <Pressable onPress={handleRestore}>
      Restore Purchase
    </Pressable>
  </>
)}
```

## ✨ User Experience

**Before:** Confusing and inaccurate  
**After:** 
- ✅ Clear what's free vs paid
- ✅ Accurate feature comparison
- ✅ Easy upgrade path
- ✅ Restore option visible
- ✅ Professional presentation

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Implement in-app purchase logic for "Upgrade to Pro"
2. Implement restore purchase logic
3. (Optional) Hide buttons if already Pro
4. Test the upgrade flow end-to-end

---

**Result:** Users now have a clear, accurate understanding of Free vs Pro with easy access to upgrade! 🎉
