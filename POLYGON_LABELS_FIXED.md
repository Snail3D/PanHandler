# Polygon Labels Fixed! ðŸ”·âœ¨

## Issue
Polygon measurements (automatically created from 3+ connected distance lines) were not showing labels on the measurement overlay.

## Root Cause
The label rendering code was missing handling for the `'polygon'` measurement mode. It had cases for:
- `distance`
- `angle`
- `circle`
- `rectangle`
- `freehand`

But **not** for `polygon`.

## Solution

### 1. **Added Polygon Label Positioning** (Line ~4571)
Added a new case in the label positioning logic to calculate the centroid of polygon points for label placement:

```typescript
} else if (measurement.mode === 'polygon') {
  // Label at centroid of polygon
  if (measurement.points && measurement.points.length > 0) {
    // Calculate centroid
    let sumX = 0, sumY = 0;
    measurement.points.forEach(p => {
      const screenPoint = imageToScreen(p.x, p.y);
      sumX += screenPoint.x;
      sumY += screenPoint.y;
    });
    screenX = sumX / measurement.points.length;
    screenY = sumY / measurement.points.length;
  }
}
```

### 2. **Updated Label Text to Show Perimeter** (Line ~4661)
Updated the label text logic to show **perimeter** for polygons (just like closed freehand loops), since the full value (with area) is shown in the legend:

```typescript
{/* For closed freehand loops and polygons, show only perimeter on label (area is in legend) */}
{(measurement.mode === 'freehand' || measurement.mode === 'polygon') && measurement.perimeter
  ? (showCalculatorWords ? getCalculatorWord(measurement.perimeter) : measurement.perimeter)
  : (showCalculatorWords ? getCalculatorWord(measurement.value) : measurement.value)
}
```

### 3. **Added Polygon to Legend** (Line ~5041)
Updated the legend value display logic to properly show both perimeter and area for polygons:

```typescript
} else if ((measurement.mode === 'freehand' || measurement.mode === 'polygon') && measurement.perimeter && measurement.area !== undefined) {
  // Show perimeter and area for closed freehand loops and polygons
  return measurement.value; // Already formatted as "perimeter (A: area)"
}
```

## How It Works Now

When you create a polygon (by drawing 3+ distance lines that form a closed shape):

1. **On the Shape**: A label appears at the **centroid** (center) showing the **perimeter** (e.g., "45.2mm")
2. **In the Legend**: The full measurement shows **both perimeter AND area** (e.g., "45.2mm (A: 125.4mmÂ²)")
3. **Hide Labels Button**: Polygon labels now respect the "Hide labels" toggle in the control menu âœ…

## What Was Already Working

- âœ… Polygon visual rendering (filled area, outline, corner markers)
- âœ… Automatic detection when 3+ lines form a closed shape
- âœ… Polygon data structure with perimeter and area
- âœ… Success haptic when polygon closes

## What's Now Fixed

- âœ… Labels show up on polygons
- âœ… Labels positioned at centroid
- âœ… Labels show perimeter (area in legend)
- âœ… Labels hide with "Hide labels" button
- âœ… Legend shows full perimeter + area

**Ready to test!** Draw 3+ distance lines that connect to form a closed shape, and watch the polygon label appear! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”·
