# Version 3.9.5 - Stable Checkpoint âœ…

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: STABLE - Known Good State  
**Previous Version**: 3.9.0

---

## Purpose
This version serves as a **stable checkpoint** after completing the Map Scale Modal UI polish and fixes. All features tested and working.

---

## Changes in 3.9.5

### Map Scale Modal Improvements
- **Fixed blank space issue**: Removed forced modal stretching by eliminating `bottom` constraint
- **Modal sizing**: Now uses `maxHeight: 85%` and sizes naturally to content
- **LOCK IN button always visible**: Button now always shows at bottom, grayed out when invalid
- **Better user feedback**: Alert popup guides user when trying to submit with invalid scale
- **Magnetic Declination collapsible**: Section can expand/collapse to save space
- **Proper validation flow**: Clear messaging when scale values are incomplete

### Help Icon Position
- **Adjusted positioning**: Moved help icon slightly left (right: 128 instead of 118) for better visual alignment
