# v2.2.26 - Polygon & Map Mode Validation Fixes

## Release Date
October 17, 2025

## Summary
Fixed two critical issues: collapsed triangles in polygon detection and improved map mode validation with debugging.

---

## üêõ Issue 1: Collapsed Triangles

### User Report
> "I just formed a triangle to try and get the area and it collapsed the triangle when I made it and the area showed zero in the legend which makes sense because it collapsed the triangle into one line."

### Root Cause
The polygon detection was extracting points correctly but not validating that they form a valid polygon with non-zero area. When points are very close together or form a degenerate polygon, the area calculation returns 0.

### The Fix
Added validation to check:
1. Are all points at the same location? (collapsed)
2. Is the calculated area actually > 0?
3. Added console logging to debug point extraction

**Code added:**
```typescript
// Check if all points are at the same location (collapsed polygon)
if (polygonPoints.length >= 2) {
  const first = polygonPoints[0];
  const allSame = polygonPoints.every(p => 
    Math.abs(p.x - first.x) < 1 && Math.abs(p.y - first.y) < 1
  );
  if (allSame) {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è All polygon points are at the same location (collapsed), skipping');
    return;
  }
}
```

## üêõ Issue 2: Still Able to Place Points in Map Mode

### User Report
> "Also, I was still able to place a point going into map mode without needing to scale."

### Investigation
The validation check exists but may not be triggering in all cases. Added console logging to debug:

```typescript
console.log('üîç Touch check:', { isMapMode, hasMapScale: !!mapScale });
if (isMapMode && !mapScale) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Blocking measurement - no map scale set');
  // Show alert...
}
```

### Possible Causes
1. **Timing:** User taps while modal is opening
2. **State race:** isMapMode not set yet when entering map mode
3. **Different flow:** User entered via a flow we didn't account for

### Debug Output
Now logs:
- Is in map mode?
- Does map scale exist?
- When blocking measurement

This will help identify exactly when/how the validation is being bypassed.

## Technical Details

### File Modified
`/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`

### Changes
1. **Lines 1641-1649:** Added collapsed polygon validation
2. **Lines 3169-3171:** Added console logging for map mode validation

### Testing Needed
1. Form triangle ‚Üí Check if it collapses
2. Enter map mode without scale ‚Üí Try to place point
3. Check console logs to see validation state

---

## Next Steps

If the map mode validation is still being bypassed, the console logs will show us:
- What is isMapMode when touch occurs?
- What is mapScale when touch occurs?
- Is the check even running?

This will tell us exactly where the bug is.
