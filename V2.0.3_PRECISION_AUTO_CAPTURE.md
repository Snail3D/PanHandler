# v2.0.3 - Precision Auto-Capture (~1mm Accuracy)

## Version
**2.0.2 → 2.0.3**

## Changes

### 🎯 More Precise Auto-Capture Alignment

**User Request**: "I want auto mode to be a little bit more precise maybe within 1 mm (on the screen)"

**Implementation**:

#### Alignment Thresholds (lines 684-690)
- **Good (triggers capture)**: Within ~1mm (6 pixels) and < 1.5° tilt
  - Calculation: Typical phone screen ~160 PPI = 6.3 pixels/mm, so 6px ≈ 1mm
  - Previous: 8 pixels (~1.3mm) and < 3° tilt
  
- **Warning (getting close)**: Within ~2mm (12 pixels) and < 5° tilt
  - Previous: 15 pixels (~2.4mm) and < 8° tilt

#### Stability Thresholds (lines 662-669)
- **Angle stability**: 1.5° tolerance (matches alignment precision)
  - Previous: 3° tolerance
  
- **Motion stability**: 0.2 threshold (tighter for stable capture)
  - Previous: 0.3 threshold

## Technical Details

**Precision Calculation**:
- Average phone screen: ~160 PPI (pixels per inch)
- 1 inch = 25.4 mm
- Therefore: 160 / 25.4 = ~6.3 pixels per mm
- Target: 1mm = ~6 pixels

**Threshold Comparison**:

| Metric | v2.0.2 (Relaxed) | v2.0.3 (Precise) | Change |
|--------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| Bubble distance | 8px (~1.3mm) | 6px (~1mm) | -25% tighter |
| Tilt angle | 3° | 1.5° | -50% tighter |
| Angle stability | 3° variance | 1.5° variance | -50% tighter |
| Motion stability | 0.3 threshold | 0.2 threshold | -33% tighter |

## User Impact

### Positive
- ✅ More precise auto-capture = better measurement accuracy
- ✅ Photos will be more consistently level
- ✅ Reduces need for recalibration

### Trade-off
- ⚠️ Requires steadier hands to trigger auto-capture
- ⚠️ Takes slightly longer to achieve perfect alignment
- ℹ️ Quick tap still available for manual capture if auto-capture too strict

## Testing

**Test Auto-Capture Precision**:
1. Hold shutter button
2. Align bubble within ~1mm of center (very close)
3. Keep tilt under 1.5° (minimal tilt)
4. Hold steady for stability check
5. Should auto-capture when conditions met

**If Too Strict**:
- User can still quick-tap shutter for manual capture
- Haptic feedback guides user to better alignment

## Files Changed
- `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx` - Tightened alignment and stability thresholds
- `app.json` - Version bump to 2.0.3

## Notes
- Precision is tuned for typical phone screens (~160 PPI)
- May need adjustment for tablet screens or high-DPI devices
- Balance between precision and usability
