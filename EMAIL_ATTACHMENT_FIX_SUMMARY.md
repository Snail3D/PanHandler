# Email Attachment Fix - Session Summary

## Problem
The second email attachment was displaying a blank white image with only the label visible, but no photo background.

## Root Cause
The code was capturing `overlayOnlyRef` which contained ONLY the SVG overlay elements (measurements, labels, legend) without the actual photo. When captured as PNG, it resulted in an empty transparent view that appeared white/blank in photo viewers.

## Solution
Modified both save and email functions to capture `viewRef` (which includes the photo from the parent MeasurementScreen component) for BOTH attachments:

### Attachment Behavior:
1. **First attachment**: `viewRef` captured with measurements visible
   - Full photo with all measurements
   - Legend showing all measurement values
   - Label and coin reference info
   - Same locked zoom/pan/rotation state

2. **Second attachment**: `viewRef` captured with `hideMeasurementsForCapture = true`
   - Same photo (identical orientation/zoom)
   - Label visible
   - Coin reference info visible
   - NO measurements
   - NO legend
   - NO point markers

## Files Modified

### `/home/user/workspace/src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx`
**Changes:**
- **Line 102**: Removed unused `overlayOnlyRef` ref
- **Lines 1154-1166**: Updated `handleSave` to capture `viewRef` for second attachment
- **Lines 1342-1360**: Updated `handleEmail` to capture `viewRef` for second attachment
- **Lines 2784-2797**: Simplified JSX structure, removed nested `overlayOnlyRef` View
- **Line 3606**: Fixed closing tags after removing nested View

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
// First capture - with measurements
const uri = await captureRef(viewRef.current, { format: 'png', quality: 1.0 });

// Second capture - hide measurements first
setHideMeasurementsForCapture(true);
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100)); // UI update
const labelOnlyUri = await captureRef(viewRef.current, { format: 'png', quality: 1.0 });
setHideMeasurementsForCapture(false);
```

### `/home/user/workspace/src/components/HelpModal.tsx`
**Changes:**
- **Line 888**: Updated description from "3 photos" to "2 photos"
- **Line 915**: Updated attachment count text to clarify attachments

### `/home/user/workspace/package.json`
**Changes:**
- **Line 10**: Added `clear-cache` script for easy cache management

### `/home/user/workspace/CACHE_MANAGEMENT.md`
**New file**: Complete documentation for cache management and troubleshooting

## How hideMeasurementsForCapture Works

When `hideMeasurementsForCapture` is `true`:
- **Line 2826**: Hides all measurement SVG elements (lines, circles, rectangles, angles, freehand paths)
- **Line 3125**: Hides measurement labels (the colored value badges)
- **Line 3480**: Hides the legend box

When `hideMeasurementsForCapture` is `false`:
- All measurements, labels, and legend are visible

**Always visible** (regardless of flag):
- **Lines 3432-3477**: Label and coin reference info (when `isCapturing` is true)

## Understanding viewRef vs overlayOnlyRef

### Before Fix (WRONG):
```
MeasurementScreen
  └── measurementViewRef (includes photo + overlay)
       ├── ZoomableImage (photo)
       └── DimensionOverlay
            ├── viewRef (overlay only, NO photo)
            └── overlayOnlyRef (overlay subset, NO photo) ❌ CAPTURED THIS
```

### After Fix (CORRECT):
```
MeasurementScreen
  └── measurementViewRef (includes photo + overlay) ✅ CAPTURES THIS
       ├── ZoomableImage (photo)
       └── DimensionOverlay
            └── viewRef points to measurementViewRef (has photo)
```

## Cache Management

Added comprehensive cache clearing:
- **Script**: `bun run clear-cache`
- **Clears**: Expo cache, Metro cache, node_modules cache
- **Restarts**: Dev server with `--clear` flag

### Why This Matters:
TypeScript and Metro bundler cache can cause stale errors after code changes. The new script ensures:
1. Old type definitions are cleared
2. Stale module resolutions are reset
3. Bundler rebuilds from scratch
4. Fresh compilation of all files

## Testing Checklist

To verify the fix works:

1. ✅ **Take a photo** with coin reference
2. ✅ **Calibrate** with coin
3. ✅ **Add measurements** (any types)
4. ✅ **Add a label** (e.g., "Test Part")
5. ✅ **Pan/zoom** to desired view
6. ✅ **Save or Email**

**Expected Result:**
- **Attachment 1**: Photo with measurements, legend, label, coin info
- **Attachment 2**: Same photo (exact orientation) with ONLY label and coin info

**Both attachments should:**
- Show the actual photo (not blank/white)
- Have identical zoom/pan/rotation
- Be properly oriented

## Known Non-Issues

The following TypeScript errors may appear in IDE but are **stale cache** and can be ignored:
```
ERROR: Argument of type '"freehand"' is not assignable to type 'MeasurementMode'
```

**Resolution**: Run `bun run clear-cache` or restart TypeScript server in IDE

## Architecture Notes

### Capture Flow:
1. User initiates save/email
2. `setIsCapturing(true)` - shows label/coin info
3. First capture of `viewRef.current` - full view
4. `setHideMeasurementsForCapture(true)` - hide measurements
5. Wait 100ms for UI update
6. Second capture of `viewRef.current` - label only
7. `setHideMeasurementsForCapture(false)` - restore view
8. `setIsCapturing(false)` - hide label

### Why 100ms Wait?
React state updates are asynchronous. The 100ms wait ensures:
- State change propagates to components
- UI re-renders with hidden measurements
- ViewShot captures the updated UI
- Without wait: might capture old state

## Future Considerations

If additional attachments are needed:
1. Add more state flags like `hideMeasurementsForCapture`
2. Capture `viewRef` multiple times with different visibility states
3. Always use `viewRef` (or parent ref that includes photo)
4. Never capture overlay-only refs unless transparency is truly desired

## Success Metrics

✅ Both email attachments show the photo
✅ Both attachments have identical orientation
✅ Second attachment shows label + coin info only
✅ No measurements/legend in second attachment
✅ Cache clearing prevents stale errors
✅ Users can easily clear cache via script
