# One-Time MMKV Clear Added (v3.0.3)

## Issue

After removing work session persistence, OLD persisted data was still in MMKV storage, blocking the app on startup.

## Fix

Added automatic one-time clear of old data when app starts.

**File**: `src/state/measurementStore.ts` (lines 9-24)

### How It Works

When the app starts:
1. Check if MMKV has 'measurement-settings' data
2. Parse the JSON
3. If it contains `currentImageUri` (old format with work session), DELETE IT
4. This clears the old bloated data
5. Fresh start with only settings persisted

### Code Added

```typescript
// ONE-TIME FIX: Clear old persisted session data (v3.0.3)
try {
  const oldData = storage.getString('measurement-settings');
  if (oldData) {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(oldData);
    // If it has currentImageUri, it's old format - clear and rebuild
    if (parsed?.state?.currentImageUri !== undefined) {
      console.log('ðŸ§¹ Clearing old work session data from MMKV...');
      storage.delete('measurement-settings');
      console.log('âœ… Old data cleared - app will be fast now!');
    }
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Ignore errors, just making sure we clear if needed
}
```

## Result

**Next time you restart the app:**
1. Old bloated data is automatically deleted
2. App starts fresh and fast
3. Only user settings are persisted
4. Photos should work immediately

## Testing

**Please do this:**
1. Force-close the app completely (swipe away)
2. Reopen the app
3. Look for console log: "âœ… Old data cleared - app will be fast now!"
4. Try taking a photo

The app should now be responsive! ðŸš€

**If still slow**: There might be something else blocking. Check console for any errors or let me know what you see.
